STATE guarantees will allow the financially precarious airline SAA to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months but it still requires a capital injection to strengthen its balance sheet, its directors say. At end-March 2015 SAA had total liabilities of R24bn and total assets of R14bn, with only R1.3bn in cash and a bank overdraft of R1.4bn. Its accumulated loss amounted to R24bn. Treasury provided the airline with a R4.7bn guarantee earlier this month, allowing it to finalise its 2014-15 financial statements, which were tabled in Parliament on Friday. The deadline for the 2015-16 financial statements is Friday but these have not been tabled yet.

"SAA remains undercapitalised. Four consecutive years of operating losses have further eroded the capital base. The lack of capital has hindered the directors’ ability to invest in newer and more efficient aircraft, and left the company less able to cope with the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates and the price of jet fuel," their report said. They said the impact of the cost of increased borrowings on future profitability was "significant". SAA is due to pay back R4.5bn in short-term loans in the next six months and it is negotiating with banks to restructure the facilities.
