BANKING stocks staged a turnaround on Wednesday, following remarks by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) that it may soften its stance on the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams was quoted by Reuters as saying Gordhan could ask for a review of a decision to charge him with fraud. Gordhan was charged by the NPA on Tuesday and he has to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2. Abrahams’ comments also sparked a recovery in the rand, as the local currency firmed to R14.2365/$ after the JSE’s close from R14.3653/$. It weakened to an intraday weakest level of R14.4963/$. After trading nearly 1% lower in the day, the banking index closed 0.44% higher at 6,958.90, after Tuesday’s 3.58% slide. The all share closed 0.68% lower at 51,548.10. Nedbank recovered 0.96% to R218.70 and Barclays Africa ended the day 0.46% higher at R151.19. Standard Bank added 0.31% to R140.43. Banks were also supported by global risk-off sentiment following remarks by US Federal Reserve Bank of New York president William Dudley that the central bank would likely proceed with slow, incremental rate rises in future. "Inflation is just a little bit below our target, rather than above, so I think we can afford to be quite gentle as we go, in terms of gradually removing monetary policy accommodation," he said. The Fed’s federal open market committee minutes, set to be released later on Wednesday evening, was also expected to reflect a less hawkish stance. "The recent data disappointment in the US means the Fed would be very cautious in their December rate decision," said Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking research head Mohammed Nalla.
