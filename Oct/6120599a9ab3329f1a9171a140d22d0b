Auckland — The All Blacks have named two new players for November’s northern tour and included three Barrett brothers in their travelling squad as they look to extend their record unbeaten streak. The 36-man squad to play Tests in the US, Italy, Ireland and France, also includes the return of disgraced scrumhalf Aaron Smith. Kiwi coach Steve Hansen said the northern tour was a chance to extend their record of 18 consecutive victories. "We’ve got a great opportunity to build on what we’ve done so far," he said. The uncapped All Blacks are Highlanders hooker Liam Coltman and 19-year-old Rieko Ioane, from the New Zealand Olympic sevens team. Jordie Barrett, the 19-year-old brother of 46-Test flyhalf Beauden Barrett, has been named as an "apprentice" to experience the pressures of being an All Black. A third Barrett brother, Scott, will travel as cover for lock Sam Whitelock, who could be out for three weeks with an ankle injury suffered in Saturday’s Test against Australia. AFP
