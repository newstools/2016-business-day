Defender Rivaldo Coetzee‚ who missed two Bafana Bafana assignments in the past week‚ has returned to full training with Ajax Cape Town and is expected to feature against Kaizer Chiefs away in Durban in a crunch Premier Soccer League match at the weekend. The defender‚ who turns 20 on Sunday‚ suffered a hamstring injury, but the international break gave him time to recover. It is the same with Mosa Lebusa‚ who was forced from the field with a similar affliction to Coetzee’s when Ajax played their last match in the derby against Cape Town City on September 23. Thabo Mosadi‚ the new 25-year-old signing from the University of Pretoria‚ played against City despite his own hamstring injury, but has since been rested. He also resumed training at the start of the week. "They are all medically fit, but not football fit‚" said coach Roger de Sa. "We’ll make a decision on them on Thursday before we leave. It will be a bit of a juggling act. We pushed them in training on Tuesday in particular, and they played without any pain. They seem to be fine." Also back is Prince Nxumalo‚ who was in hospital in September with a bout of meningitis. "He is getting stronger and he has been having catch-up sessions and is ready to go again." Tashreeq Morris‚ who returned from the Olympic Games with an injury‚ played 60 minutes in the weekend’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge matches for Ajax’s reserves. "I was happy with that and he is making progress‚" added the coach. TMG Digital
