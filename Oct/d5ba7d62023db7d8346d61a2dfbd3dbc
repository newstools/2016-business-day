DATACENTRIX is set to delist from the JSE following a R541m offer by Pinnacle to buy out other shareholders in the company. Pinnacle has a 57.1% stake in Datacentrix. Pinnacle has received irrevocable undertakings from Datacentrix shareholders who hold 72.05% of the remaining stake to vote in favour of the proposed scheme and the delisting, it said. The takeover could accelerate Datacentrix’s plans to expand into the rest of the continent using its parent company’s footprint. Through Datacentrix, Pinnacle has more exposure in the lucrative technology services market. Pinnacle’s core business is in the distribution of hardware technology products, while Datacentrix operates in the technology services market as a systems integrator. Datacentrix, among other services, monitors and controls all server hardware systems, operating systems, application services, databases and network devices. While Pinnacle’s move was expected, Alexander Duys, a portfolio manager at Mvunonala Asset Managers, expected the offer at a later stage given that Pinnacle "recently emerged from a weak operational performance and stretched balance sheet". Datacentrix’s delisting will further reduce the number of attractive listed technology companies for investors. Pinnacle was mentioned recently in a fraud case against a high-ranking South African National Defence Force official. This resulted in a massive fall in its share price, though it recovered later. This was the second time that Pinnacle had been drawn into tender fraud allegations in two years. Duys said that, operationally, Pinnacle was well placed to deliver shareholder value over the long term, "though the continued allegations of bribery practices within their business makes me circumspect to want to recommend it for investors at this stage". Pinnacle’s share price gained nearly 1% on Wednesday to close at R15.90.
