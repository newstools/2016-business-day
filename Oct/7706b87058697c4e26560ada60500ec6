Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba intends to take the fight to Senegal after naming Dutch-born striker Lars Veldwijk in the Bafana Bafana squad to face the West Africans in a 2018 World Cup qualifier in November. The 25-year-old Veldwijk is eligible to play for Bafana through his father‚ who was born in SA‚ and looks set to make his debut against the Senegalese at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on November 12. Mashaba said he had been monitoring the player for a long time and believed this was the best time to call him up. Star-studded Senegal are viewed as favourites in SA’s World Cup qualifying group and Mashaba admitted on Thursday that Bafana would have their work cut out against the visitors. Bafana have, at times, struggled to convert the many opportunities they create in games and it is hoped that Veldwijk‚ who recently joined Belgian top-flight side Kortrijk‚ could solve the problem.
