The country&rsquo;s four major banks have until Friday to indicate whether they will oppose Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s case on their decision to close down the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investment accounts.Gordhan wants the High Court in Pretoria to declare that he is not legally empowered to intervene in the relationship between the Guptas, their companies and the banks.The notices signalling an intention to oppose will give some indication of the attitude of the Guptas and the banks to the bombshell court application, filed by Gordhan last week.In his application, Gordhan revealed about R7bn worth of "suspicious and unusual" transactions by the Gupta family and their companies that were reported to the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) from 2012.The Guptas&rsquo; lawyers have already indicated they would oppose the application and have defended their transactions.&nbsp;But it remains unclear what the banks position will be. The case has opened the way for them to disclose the details of the suspicious transactions they reported to the FIC.If the banks plan to oppose the application, their notices need to be filed on Friday.If they do not plan to oppose, it will remain to be seen how much information they will disclose in court.Absa, First National Bank, Standard Bank of SA and Nedbank have kept silent as to why they closed the Gupta accounts.But in a June interview, former Oakbay CEO Nazeem Howa disclosed a letter from one of the banks, which stated that the law prevented it from having dealings that could directly or indirectly make it a party to or an accessory to a contravention of the law.The suspicious transaction reports, detailed in the certificate from the FIC annexed by Gordhan to his court papers began in December 2012 and continue through to 2016.But they rose drastically, in number and value, in 2016, including three worth more than R1bn in April and May.
