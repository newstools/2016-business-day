Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) executive director Robert McBride said on Thursday he was weighing his options over statements about him made by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko.On Wednesday, Nhleko said he was not prepared to work with McBride after remarks he had made during his suspension and over the misconduct allegations that got him suspended.McBride was suspended by Nhleko on allegations of having doctored an Ipid investigation report to exonerate former Hawks boss Anwa Dramat accused of illegally renditioning Zimbabweans. He was highly critical of the police minister in an application contesting the suspension in the Constitutional Court. It ruled the suspension unlawful and gave Parliament 30 days to follow the correct procedure to discipline McBride."The minister has subsequently advised Mr McBride to approach the speaker of the National Assembly for clarity on where he should be reporting under the prevailing circumstances," the statement from his office said.The speaker, Baleka Mbete, declined to reconstitute the charges, saying Parliament will only resume sitting on Tuesday next week &mdash; leaving McBride free to return to work after the expiry of the 30 days.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said McBride spent the whole Wednesday catching up on "new developments and stabilising the directorate"."The executive director is still applying his mind to the statement. He will make a decision on how to respond. However, we can confirm that he has got it. We cannot say much more until he has decided what to do.Nhleko&rsquo;s spokesman Sandile Ngidi said.: "Accountability is a serious matter here. The Constitutional Court said Ipid must be protected from political influence but it also says the head must be accountable to their political head. It is unfortunate, as the court determines that McBride still must report to the minister."
