The rand remained vulnerable on Wednesday at lunchtime, a day after it ended 4% lower against the dollar after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was summonsed to appear in court for alleged fraud. Standard Bank’s Warrick Butler said the next few days were going to be important for the local currency’s future, as its ability to strengthen below R13 to the dollar was "becoming increasingly fragile". Butler said there were multiple risk events in the coming weeks. One that had positively affected the rand was the Anheuser-Busch InBev transaction. On Wednesday evening SA-time, the US Fed’s federal open market committee will release its minutes. These will give direction about how the Fed will increase interest rates. At 11.29am the rand was at R14.4219 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R14.3653. It was at R15.9055 to the euro from R15.8802 and R17.6832 to the pound from R17.4203. The euro was at $1.1028 from $1.1054 previously
