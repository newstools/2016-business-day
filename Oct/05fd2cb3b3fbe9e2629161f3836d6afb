Market reaction to the minibudget was subdued as investors stood on the sidelines, waiting for more detail in February.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s medium-term budget policy statement has come out broadly as expected, going by the reaction on SA&rsquo;s markets.However, some economists said it would be difficult for SA to maintain its investment status without details of growth plans.Johann Els, an economist at Old Mutual, said: "The jury is out whether this [statement] will be enough to avert a ratings downgrade in December &hellip; whether they did enough will be a close call." He did say, though, that Gordhan "has again done an impressive job of setting the medium-term framework for government finances and setting out the key priorities for getting the economy back onto a higher growth trajectory".The rand lost 15c and bond yields were weaker at the conclusion of Gordhan&rsquo;s statement. The currency traded at R13.7542 to the dollar as Gordhan started his speech, and was at R13.9063 at the conclusion. It firmed to R13.8724 in later trade.The R186 government bond was initially bid at 8.765%, from a previous 8.77%, and weakened to 8.90% at the end of Gordhan&rsquo;s speech. In later trade, the yield firmed to 8.87%.The JSE all-share showed little reaction at first and continued to trade in a tight range throughout Gordhan s speech. At the conclusion, the index was 0.62% lower at 51,430.40 points, on par with its level at the start.Gordhan s allusion to fiscal slippage, a weaker growth forecast and the continuing risk of state-owned enterprises to government finances kept market sentiment subdued.The all-share curtailed some losses at the close, ending the day 0.38% lower at 51,552.30 as global mining stocks found support from the weaker rand. Banks also recovered.On the sharp increases in SA s tax burden, Stanlib economist Kevin Lings said the details would only be outlined in next year s budget, but presumably they would flow from some of the recommendations of the Davis tax committee.Dawie Roodt, an independent economist, expressed disappointment, in particular about the extent to which tax revenues had fallen short of expectations. Nothing in the speech indicated that the government was prepared to go the extra mile to back small business, "nor was it planning to plug the endless outflow of cash to state-owned entities like South African Airways and Eskom", he said
