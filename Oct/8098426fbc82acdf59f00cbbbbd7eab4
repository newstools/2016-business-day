Former world No1 Caroline Wozniacki beat unseeded French challenger Kristina Mladenovic to take the Hong Kong Open on Sunday after a battle of wills that lasted almost three hours. Wozniacki stormed the first set 6-1 with Mladenovic visibly despondent and limping slightly. The 23-year-old French woman emerged in the second set with her right leg bandaged and renewed focus, forcing Wozniacki to dive around the court with a combination of drop shots and powerful drives. The set went to 6-6, with Mladenovic sealing the tie-break 7-4 to go even with temperatures at 30° C. A determined Wozniacki finally sealed victory in the third set as a tired Mladenovic was ultimately unable to match the Dane’s power and consistency, often leaning on her racquet between points. Wozniacki took the final set 6-2. AFP
