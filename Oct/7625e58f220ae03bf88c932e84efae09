ASIAN stock exchanges trading ahead of the JSE’s opening on Friday morning were generally red. Frankfurt’s DAX 30 index closed 0.52% higher and Paris’s CAC 40 index 0.44% higher on Thursday after the European Central Bank announced no change in its monetary policy. But Tokyo and Shanghai took their cue from Wall Street where the S&P 500 closed 0.14% lower and the Nasdaq index 0.09% lower, dragged down by Microsoft falling 0.49% to $57.25 despite releasing results which beat analysts’ expectations. Nintendo fell 5.25% to ¥25,555 after unveiling its new game console which appears to have not impressed investors, dragging Tokyo’s Topix index down 0.12%. The Hong Kong stock exchange was closed on Friday as the city braced itself for Typhoon Haima. Uncertainty about whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be able to implement an accord to reduce output when they gather at an official meeting in November saw international oil prices weaken on Friday morning.
