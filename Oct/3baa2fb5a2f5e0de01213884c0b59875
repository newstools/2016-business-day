BREXIT and the recent Conservative Party conference destroyed any hope SABMiller’s South African shareholders might have had of a forex-related boost to their payout from Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev). On Wednesday, AB InBev announced the applicable rate it used to convert the £45 into rands was R17.66304. So South African shareholders got a relatively unexciting R791.65 for each of their SABMiller shares. This represents a 5.5% premium on the R750 at which SABMiller was trading in October 2015 before AB InBev formally announced its proposed takeover. The share price had increased in anticipation of the takeover announcement so R750 did include an element of takeover premium. The R17.66304 applicable rate was an average of the rand/ sterling exchange rate in the three weeks from September 19 to October 10. Renewed concern about the UK’s exit from the EU hit sterling’s value against all currencies, including the rand, during this period. Sentiment towards sterling turned especially weak after the Conservative Party conference in the first weekend of October. The October 10 cut-off date for calculating the rate meant SABMiller shareholders missed out on the slump in the rand that followed the decision of the National Prosecuting Authority to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud on Tuesday. Within hours of completing the £75bn transaction, AB InBev announced it had finalised the sale of a hefty chunk of SABMiller’s operations. The disposals, which accounted for around 50% of SABMiller’s annual turnover, have been under discussion since the deal was initially announced in November last year. The total proceeds from the sales are $16.5bn with Miller-Coors going for $12bn, CR Snow for $1.6bn and Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime for just under $3bn. The beer giant is also in talks to sell its central and eastern European brands.
