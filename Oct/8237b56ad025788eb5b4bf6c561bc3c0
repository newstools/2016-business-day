Universities will receive an additional R17bn over the next three years, making them the biggest winner of Wednesday&rsquo;s medium-term budget statement.The policy statement hints, though, that free higher education is not on the cards.The R17bn &mdash; which includes R7.6bn to universities to compensate for the fees freeze for students whose families earn less than R600,000 a year and another R9.2bn to bolster the National Student Financial Aid Scheme &ndash; follows February&rsquo;s additional allocation of R11.2bn.This makes post-school funding the second fastest growing item in the budget over the past five years after debt costs.&nbsp;While the 2016 increase for the student aid scheme was intended in part to cover outstanding debt, the 2017 allocation is intended to ensure students are better funded and, for those on the scheme, the full costs of study are covered. This will depend on enrolment, which the Treasury hints has been growing at unsustainable levels.SA now spends 1.5% of GDP on post-school training up from 1% in 2008. However, most of the benefit has gone to vocational colleges and sector education training authorities.Alarmingly, the Treasury notes that a recent review it conducted on the technical and vocational education and training colleges revealed a through-put rate of only 10%.Speaking to the media alongside Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said the plan was to expand the college sector. While through-put rates were low, pass rates had increased to about 40%.The budget statement cautions that "a road map" is needed to fully finance the costs of study for poor students.Gordhan said all stakeholders were invited to participate in finding solutions. "We need a road map for the future, but not one on the basis of I will burn the next bus or else. "
