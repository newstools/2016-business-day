Defence and Military Veterans Deputy Minister Kebby Maphatsoe has hit out at former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) who are planning to boycott the organisation&rsquo;s 55th anniversary celebrations this Friday.The group of former soldiers is unhappy about the people, including former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe&sbquo; SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni&sbquo; and SABC head of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng&sbquo; who are due to receive awards for their "work on transformation".The MK Veterans Association in Gauteng&rsquo;s deputy provincial secretary&sbquo; Archie Mogodiri&sbquo; has called on other vets to boycott Friday&rsquo;s event.Maphatsoe said they had introduced a new category during this year&rsquo;s anniversary celebrations "to acknowledge people who have played a role in transformation" and "to honour them while they are still alive"."I don t understand why they re shifting around and making a noise when we are celebrating an African person " he said."[Hlaudi] has helped transform the SABC to where it is today. He has changed the lives of the workers and he has changed the lives of the musicians " said Maphatsoe.He said Motsoeneng was the calibre of person who should be deployed in government institutions."We thought we should honour Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng while he was still alive and empowering musicians."Maphatsoe said Molefe and Myeni were of a similar calibre in their work to promote transformation in SA."She has also played a very important role to transform SAA.... Dudu Myeni is trying to transform SAA so South Africans can benefit [when doing business with the airline] " he said.TMG Digital
