The rand continued to firm against major currencies on Thursday, trading at a two-week high against the dollar, which was weaker against its peers on a combination of year-end profit-taking, weaker than expected economic data and lower treasury yields.The rand was also boosted by an increased global demand for commodities, which saw the price of gold surge.Gold reached a level of $1,150.18 per oz from $1,141.34/oz at its last close.The rand hit a best morning level of R13.6705 against the dollar. But the dollar&rsquo;s slide is not expected to last long with anticipated interest-rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve next year.At 11.03am, the rand was R13.7153 to the dollar from Wednesday&rsquo;s close of R13.8382. It was R14.3314 to the euro from R14.4196 and R16.8216 to the pound from R16.9348.The euro was at $1.0449 from $1.0412.Thursday afternoon sees the release of local trade data for November. Barring any big surprises, the figures are unlikely to have a significant effect on the rand.
