University of the Witwatersrand students have reacted with anger to the news that the institution will hike 2017 fees to the maximum 8%, saying this has caught them off guard and they feel undermined. Wits student representative council general secretary David Manibilie said: "We are frustrated and saddened by this move for many reasons — one being that students can’t afford the enormous fees that the university charges. "We were consulted only once in this whole process and that was this past Wednesday." Students want a freeze on fee increments until they can get free higher education. Manibilie said they would wait for students to return in January and discuss with them whether or not they would take to the streets in protest. Wits spokeswoman Shirona Patel said the university would institute the 8% fee increase as it faced a R191m deficit. "The ICT projects for next year, the cost of insourcing and the R54m that the university didn’t get from the state in 2016 [prompted the fee hike]," said Patel. Programmes at the Wits Scool of Governance will increase by 9.5%, all other postgraduate courses will increase at 8%. "The university has no choice but to increase fees if it is to remain financially sustainable ... utilities need to be paid and infrastructure needs to be maintained," she said. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said in September that universities could hike 2017 fees up to 8%. The South African Students Congress’ Mpendulo Mseka said it had been caught off guard. "It was orchestrated by the university long ago — after comrades wrote exams they were sent home," said Mseka. Responding to the university would be narrow-minded. The students, and the congress, should take the fight to the government, he said.
