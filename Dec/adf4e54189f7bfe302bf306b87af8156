Gauteng Premier David Makhura says some government officials ran to the ANC opposing the open tender system, saying it will block black business people from winning tenders."I told them I will see them in the ANC and we will deal with this on the ANC platform," the premier said at a networking session with the media on Thursday.Makhura&rsquo;s sentiments showed the extent of the split brought about by the open tender system in the province.Under the system, the procurement of goods and services in the council will be transparent and open to public scrutiny.On Monday, ANC councillors did not show up for the City of Johannesburg special council meeting to vote on the open tender system, among other things, suggesting there was a deep split in the party on the issue.They were also supposed to vote on whether the municipality s entities, such as City Parks and Zoo, Johannesburg Road Agency, City Power and Pikitup. should be absorbed back into the city.Only the city s governing DA and the EFF were present."The open tender is what the ANC government practices in the Gauteng province."There is nothing that suggests that the ANC is against the open tender," said ANC Johannesburg spokesman and councillor Jolidee Matongo.The meeting initially took place on Friday, but had to be postponed after councillors clashed over certain items on the agenda."Immediately after that meeting [on Friday] we had our own ANC council meeting where we reflected on the way the council is run."We then thought there needs to be some cooling off period," Matongo said.However, the council still went ahead and the ANC decided not to participate, he said.Matongo said the ANC s decision had nothing to do with sabotaging the meeting because the party had said since August that it accepted its role as the opposition and the parties present could reach a quorum without them.The council did not reach a quorum on Monday because some members from the DA were not present, and the meeting was postponed until January.
