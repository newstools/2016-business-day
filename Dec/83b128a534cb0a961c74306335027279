London &mdash; Oil prices surged to their highest since mid 2015 and US treasury yields hit a more than two-year peak on Monday after the world&rsquo;s top crude producers agreed to cut output.Coming at the start of a week when the US is expected to raise interest rates for the only the second time since the global financial crisis, the weekend agreement between oil cartel Opec and key non-Opec states set the markets on fire.Brent oil futures soared more than 5% to top $57 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 and US crude leapt above $54 a barrel to send global inflation gauges spiking as well. There was particular surprise as Saudi Arabia, the world&rsquo;s number one producer, said it may cut its output even more than it had first suggested at an Opec meeting just more than a week ago."The original Opec deal pointed to a fairly lumpy 3% cut [in production], so this suggests there is a bit more upside for oil prices," said Neil Williams, chief economist at fund manager Hermes.On the rise in bond yields, which tend to set global borrowing costs, he added: "The Fed hike is mostly baked in so when we do get it, it will be more about the statement."European oil companies jumped more than 2% on the oil surge and helped the pan-regional Stoxx50 index add 0.2%, having just had its best week in exactly five years.Bond markets in contrast were under heavy pressure. Eurozone government bond yields opened sharply higher with German bunds up five basis points at 0.40% as US yields topped 2.5% for the first time since October 2014."We have seen Opec and non-Opec producers agreeing, which is boosting reflation expectations around the world," IG Markets institutional dealer Chris Weston said.In another sign of the reflation trade, breakeven rates &mdash; the gap between yields of five-year US debt and a matching tenor in inflation-protected securities &mdash; were at two-month highs.Fed upFocus was also on the currency markets as the dollar rose to its highest since February against the Japanese yen, before what is almost certain to be the first rate hike of the year from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Japan&rsquo;s yen also tends to suffer when oil prices rise, since the country is a major importer.The Norwegian crown, Canadian dollar and Russia rouble were the big gainers from the oil deal. The rouble rose almost 2% against both the dollar and euro.Overnight in Asia, MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5% after posting its biggest weekly rise in nearly three months last week.Chinese stocks suffered their biggest fall in six months as blue chips were knocked by fresh regulatory curbs to rein in insurers&rsquo; aggressive stock investments and rising bond yields prompted profit-taking in equities.The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 2.4%, to 3,409.18 points, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.5% to 3,152.97 points.China&rsquo;s insurance regulator, which recently warned it would curb "barbaric" acquisitions by insurers, said late on Friday it had suspended the insurance arm of China&rsquo;s Evergrande Group from conducting stock market investment.Emerging markets are already bracing for a difficult run if US rate hikes push up the dollar and global bond yields.Turkey&rsquo;s lira has borne the brunt of much of the pressure in recent weeks, and it took another 1% hit alongside Turkish bonds after data showed the country&rsquo;s economy suffering its first contraction since 2009.Gold, meanwhile, which had a bumper first half of 2016, hit its lowest level since early February at $1,152/oz.Reuters
