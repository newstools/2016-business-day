Cape Town City have more peaks to conquer in their sights this season, was coach Eric Tinkler&rsquo;s warning in the wake of the club&rsquo;s remarkable victory in the Telkom Knockout final in Polokwane on Saturday.City&sbquo; who first kicked a ball competitively less than four months ago&sbquo; defeated SuperSport United 2-1 to lift a maiden piece of silverware for the club and raise the question&sbquo; how far can it go?They top the league&sbquo; albeit having played more games than their major title rivals&sbquo; and are in a fantastic run of form.It is a rise not dissimilar to Leicester City in the English Premier League last season&sbquo; when everybody expected The Foxes&rsquo; form to dip&sbquo; but they got stronger as the season wore on and eventually lifted the league trophy in one of the greatest stories in the history of sport.City have now won nine of their last 10 matches&sbquo; their only blemish a 1-1 draw at Kaizer Chiefs in a game they probably should have won too.They have beaten African champions Mamelodi Sundowns&sbquo; Wits and now SuperSport&sbquo; three big-spending sides&sbquo; in that run&sbquo; a statement of their quality if ever there was one.They have also scored two goals or more in eight of those 10 matches showing this is not a side that grind out results but play with intent and flair.A jubilant Tinkler who claimed the first title of his career after losses with Orlando Pirates in the African Confederation Cup and Nedbank Cup finals says the goal for now remains 30 points in the league and safety from relegation."You just keep climbing game by game " he said."Our target is no different to hit that 30-point mark. We need another two wins to achieve that then we start aiming higher after that," Tinkler said.The coach is the glue that holds the team together but typical of him, he handed all the credit to his players."I m very very proud of the boys; the character they have shown over the past four months the work ethic they have had the determination they have shown."I am extremely proud of what we have achieved in a very short time."They deserve it. Right from day one when we beat Polokwane [City] I saw something special and four months later you lift your first trophy. It s phenomenal," he said.Tinkler felt his side were worthy winners and that they should have scored more goals before SuperSport equalised through Kingston Nkhatha."We knew that we needed to score the second I said that at half-time but we needed to simplify our game. Our transition on attack was very very good they didn t know how to deal with us but we were looking for the difficult pass."We could have played it simple we would have created those chances and buried them. We could have been three or four up at one stage."Then we allowed them in through the back door from a set piece which we knew was a threat. But immediately after that very simple one-two one-two we get into their box and buried it."Tinkler hinted at a "serious" afterparty for the players on Saturday night but they will have to turn attention back to the league immediately as they host Platinum Stars on Tuesday night.Mother City neighbours Ajax Cape Town won the MTN8 title in 2015 but then went winless for nine games.Tinkler will be wary of falling into the same trap of his players dropping their intensity with one trophy already in the cabinet.TMG Digital
