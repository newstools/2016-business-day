The Department of Basic Education has instructed public schools to condone all Grade 7 to 9 pupils who have obtained 20% in mathematics.The Herald reported on Wednesday that the department told schools to bypass the requirements of the national curriculum.Newly appointed head of the Western Cape education department&sbquo; Brian Schreuder&sbquo; confirmed the directive in an interview with CapeTalk Radio.He said the major reason for this was concern that pupils were passing all of their other subjects but failing mathematics &ndash; a compulsory subject to pass."It is true that there is an adjustment that has been made for mathematics&sbquo;" he said.He explained that an education task team had recommended several years ago that the pass rate for mathematics be increased to 40% while other subject pass rates were 30%.He said the system needed a chance to adjust to the change in promotion requirements."It&rsquo;s not fair that one cohort of learners this year suddenly have a more stringent pass rate than last year&rsquo;s learners&hellip;. And so the national Department of Education is attempting to put in a transitionary process whereby the impact of that decision or increase of standard is phased in over a number of years with adjustment or condonation specifically for grades seven&sbquo; eight and nine&sbquo;" he said.The directive was the result of the department fielding complaints about pupils passing six subjects but not mathematics&sbquo; meaning they could not progress to a further education and training (FET) college or Grade 10.Now those who achieve a 20% pass in mathematics will progress to the next grade."Mathematics is a huge problem in our society. The quality of mathematics passes&sbquo; the number of passes is a challenge&sbquo;" said Schreuder.TMG Digital/The Herald
