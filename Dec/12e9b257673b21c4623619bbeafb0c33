Cricketers will have to continue keeping their mints under their tongues to avoid punishment for transgressing the game&rsquo;s ball-tampering regulations.That is the upshot of a decision by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) world cricket committee to recommend not changing the laws on the illegal but widespread practice of using artificial aids &mdash; sugar is a prime suspect &mdash; to help the ball retain its shine."The world cricket committee believes that no changes should be made to law 42.3(a): the match ball &mdash; changing its condition&sbquo;" the MCC said.The MCC, the custodian of cricket&rsquo;s laws, is due to present a revised version of the laws in time for implementation on October 1 next year.The ball-tampering issue hit the headlines in Australia last month when South African captain Faf du Plessis made the mistake of allowing television cameras to capture a mint in his mouth as he wet his fingers to work on the ball. He was found guilty&sbquo; fined and docked three demerit points.But there was lots of support for Du Plessis&sbquo; including from Australian captain Steve Smith, who said: "We, along with every other team around the world, shine the ball the same way."That didn&rsquo;t cut much ice with the MCC, which said: "The recent incident involving Faf du Plessis brought this law into focus, but MCC&rsquo;s position &mdash; supported by the world cricket committee &mdash; is that the law is clear&sbquo; and to try to be too prescriptive by listing banned substances would be counterproductive&sbquo; as something will be missed in the process of such drafting."TMG Digital
