Nepotism in filling senior positions is rife in Mpumalanga, but it is difficult to unravel the corruption as tracks are well covered, the South African Council for Educators (Sace) told MPs on Wednesday.The teachers&rsquo; regulatory body has come under fire in recent weeks for producing a "whitewash" report that found no evidence of teaching and administrative positions in the Department of Basic Education being bought or sold.Allegations are that the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu), which dominates the 30-member Sace council, put pressure on the regulatory body to produce a report that effectively cleared the union.In 2014, Sace and the department launched two separate probes after allegations emerged that Sadtu officials were selling teaching and administrative positions for R30,000 or more at schools in the Eastern Cape&sbquo; KwaZulu-Natal&sbquo; Limpopo&sbquo; Gauteng&sbquo; Mpumalanga and North West.While the department&rsquo;s probe found evidence of widespread corruption in the allocation of teaching posts, the Sace report concluded that no evidence of wrongdoing could be found.Officials from Sace and teacher unions on Wednesday appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s basic education portfolio committee to discuss the jobs-for-cash scandal.Sace CEO Rej Brijraj told MPs there were suspicions that department officials were involved in wrongdoing but due to fear of being victimised, no one was willing to come forward to testify against them."Sadtu itself requested Sace to investigate this phenomenon [selling of teacher posts]."Our investigations could not yield any tangible evidence of wrongdoing on the part of any educator no one was prepared to avail themselves as witnesses as much as we have our suspicions, Sace processes require us to conduct a fair hearing. We need to have witnesses and evidence so that we can charge people," Brijraj said.DA MP Gavin Davis said it was clear Sadtu had pressured Sace to sanitise its report.Sadtu officials said there was no evidence that they had influenced the outcome of the Sace report. Sadtu also hit out at the ministerial task team s jobs-for-cash report, saying the document was part of an attempt to destroy the union by portraying all its members as corrupt.The union said the report had racist undertones as it sought to portray its majority black members as unethical.Sadtu deputy general secretary Nkosana Dolopi said the report only mentioned seven members belonging to Sadtu, yet it seemed as though all 260,000 members were viewed with suspicion.
