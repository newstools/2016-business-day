While recent widespread rains have brought some relief&sbquo; "parts of the Northern Cape&sbquo; Western Cape&sbquo; North West&sbquo; Limpopo and the Free State are still in the grip of the worst drought this decade".That is according to Agri SA&sbquo; which on Monday reiterated its call for donations to assist needy farmers.Agri SA president Johannes M&ouml;ller said: "Agri SA alone cannot meet the farmers&rsquo; needs and therefore we call urgently for financial contributions."He said that while the agricultural association had "launched various initiatives to provide needy farmers countrywide with drought relief"&sbquo; the "time has now come for the government to provide further assistance to commercial and small-scale farmers to help them survive"."The shortage of funds has now resulted in Agri SA being unable to provide further assistance and we therefore call urgently on the private sector to make further contributions to the Agri SA drought-relief fund."He said Agri SA was concerned about the welfare of farmers and farm workers and the humanitarian effect of the drought."A drought is not a one-year phenomenon &mdash; the western parts of the country&sbquo; where devastating drought conditions have been experienced over the past three years&sbquo; can testify to this."TMG Digital
