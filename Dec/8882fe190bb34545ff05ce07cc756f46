Alleged irregularities surrounding the Financial Services Board&rsquo;s (FSB) cancellations of thousands of fund registrations deserved a "better and bigger" investigation because previous FSB investigations were not well resourced, the High Court in Pretoria heard on Thursday.The regulator also had a duty to correct its mistakes.Chris Loxton, SC, counsel for former deputy pension funds registrar Rosemary Hunter, told the court in closing arguments there should be a "better or bigger" investigation because the FSB had recognised where there was any suspicion beneficiaries of the funds had suffered any harm from the cancellations, it had a duty to investigate and undo cancellations."A better or bigger investigation [is] never to be done by a one-man band," said Loxton."If there are two main questions &ndash; should the FSB be required to appoint an investigator to investigate the cancellations project, there is a case on the papers that they should be ordered to do so."Do they have a duty, where the [fund] administrator realises that a mistake has been made, if there is a duty to correct, then there must be a duty to investigate whether a mistake has been made."Hunter is seeking an order for a court-appointed investigator to probe the FSB s decision to cancel the registrations of 4,600 funds, which did not have a board of trustees, assets, or liabilities. The FSB had commissioned retired judge Kate O Regan to investigate the "irregularities" Hunter had flagged. O Regan asked for a full forensic audit, which was conducted by KPMG. It found some fund registrations were cancelled with potential financial prejudice of R2.5bn to beneficiaries.The FSB appointed independent pension fund lawyer Jonathan Mort to study the KPMG report. Mort, in his first report to the FSB in June, criticised KPMG, finding that 46% of the funds in the KPMG sample had not suffered any actual prejudice.Loxton conceded criticism had been directed at KPMG, but asked why the FSB did not stop the audit firm and appoint an equivalent institution if it believed it was doing a bad job."In a couple of days over 500 funds were cancelled with one person overseeing the process. If all the work was done, why were mistakes then made?"Wim Trengove, SC, for the FSB and its chairman, Abel Sithole, argued Hunter was raising a new argument for the first time. "This was never one of Hunter s causes of action," he told the court. "We say they [KPMG] did the investigation that O Regan recommended."
