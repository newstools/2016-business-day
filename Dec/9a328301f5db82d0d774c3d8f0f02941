Windsor — SA’s Chad le Clos continued his success at the Short Course World Swimming Championships with his third gold, in the 50m butterfly. Le Clos, who had smashed his own world record to claim gold in the 100m butterfly on Thursday, was once again too hot for the competition. The 24-year-old hit the wall in 21.98sec, almost half a second faster than American Tom Shields, who took silver in 22.40. Australia’s David Morgan won bronze in 22.47. But Le Clos‚ who took the 200m freestyle silver last week‚ was unable to progress beyond the heats of the 100m freestyle on Saturday‚ his 48.31 more than half-a-second off a spot in the semifinals. Fellow Olympian Doug Erasmus got closer with his 47.96‚ but he too was eliminated. At the same time Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu powered to her sixth gold medal Saturday with another dominant display in her all-conquering year. Swimming’s "Iron Lady" — a star of the Rio Olympics where she won three gold medals — finished more than two seconds clear of her nearest rival to claim the 200m individual medley crown. The 27-year-old had already lit up the championships with victories in the 100m medley, 400m medley, 200m butterfly and both the 100m and 200m backstrokes. On Saturday she added to her haul, leading from start to finish to come home in 2min 2.9sec, ahead of Ella Eastin of the US, who touched in 2:05.02. AFP
