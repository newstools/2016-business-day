In what looks like an uncomfortable reversal of roles, President Jacob Zuma may have put the country&rsquo;s CEOs on the spot with his decision to endorse the recommendation of zero salary increase for top public office bearers in 2017.The recommendation will affect a large swathe of well-paid public-sector employees including ministers, deputy ministers, MPs, judges, mayors, traditional leaders, and councillors. And of course, the president. Remarkably, this sees the government setting the tone on a high-profile and controversial issue.The question now is whether the private sector will, as the CEO Pledge exhorts, do the right thing. While businesses do not rely on taxpayers to fund their executive remuneration, those that are listed (the most generous payers by a long stretch) do rely on pension-backed shareholders.Their extravagance also sets the tone for the government&rsquo;s pay excesses as well as aggravating inequality."The government is leading from the front on this issue and leaders in both the public and private sectors are now under pressure to follow its lead," says Mark Bussin, executive director of the South African Rewards Association."We are a very unequal society and the fact that the economy is not growing is making this disparity even worse and ratcheting up social tensions," Bussin says.Bussin says those who lead the country and society need to exercise restraint."This is an excellent foundation for rebuilding social trust and cohesion."He says the pay freeze should be taken very seriously by big business."The massive salaries paid to top executives and the gap between them and the lower ranks of employees have been a source of widespread dissatisfaction both in SA and globally," Bussin says.Nick Icely, associate consultant on remuneration at Deloitte, agrees the zero increase sends a message to remuneration committees and expects to see restraint on total guaranteed pay awards.But Icely says the big issue is not the size of the guaranteed pay package but the bonuses and long-term incentives added on. He says SA&rsquo;s extreme levels of inequality are always on the agenda at remuneration committee meetings and some of the big companies are talking about freezing share awards for a few years.Bussin also says the recently released King IV code will have a restraining effect on executive pay. The Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers explained the zero increase recommendation was as a result of economic distress.The minister of finance had asked the commission "to seriously consider the impact of increases on the already struggling economy".There is no money for salary increases, said the minister, unless the state borrowed the money. The commission believes "in difficult economic times" it is appropriate for high-income earners to make sacrifices and says it is important "for those in leadership positions to be exemplary".Gerald Seegers, director at PwC, cautions against taking a cheerier view of responsible government leadership. "It is a commendable gesture but one will always be suspicious while fraud and corruption is rife within the public sector and it appears to be riddled with poor governance and disregard for the poor."Seegers says many private-sector executives have been taking zero or below-inflation increases (in guaranteed pay) for some time largely because of the focus on the wage gap.But he says the debate continues to rage around the level of their incentives.Companies that will be watched closely for signs of restraint in 2017 include Standard Bank, Steinhoff International, Clover, Pioneer Foods, and Capitec.Integrated Reporting and Assurance Services has calculated that these are the least equitable companies on the JSE.Standard Bank, which has retrenched thousands of workers in the past few years, tops the list with an income disparity ratio of a shocking 473, which means the average package (including incentives) of its top executives is 473 times that of the average employee.Steinhoff's is 370, Clover 200, Pioneer 184 and Capitec 170.Head of IRAS Michael Rae says for Standard Bank it means that before the close of business on January 2 2017 a Standard Bank executive will have scored what it takes the average employee all year to earn.Rae also points out the income disparity ratio is likely to be greater in the retail sector where the vast majority of jobs are low-skilled. Time for the private sector to "do the right thing".&nbsp;In a previous version of this article it was incorrectly stated that The Foschini Group (TFG) was one of the least equitable companies on the JSE. Business Day regrets the mistake, which was due to a calculation error by IRAS (Integrated Reporting and Assurance Services). TFG is not in the IRAS Top 20 least equitable companies. It features at only 45th place.
