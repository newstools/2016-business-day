The price of petrol is expected to rise by 51c a litre in January while diesel will rise by about 40c/litre, the Automobile Association (AA) said on Thursday.The official announcement of petrol price increases will be made by the Central Energy Fund on behalf of the Department of Energy on Friday.The AA said January&rsquo;s was likely to be the first of a series of fuel price increases during 2017. It would reflect a weakening of the rand against the dollar since mid-December combined with a steady rise in international oil prices.The AA said it was too early to tell at what price global supply would match demand after the Opec decision to cut production.
