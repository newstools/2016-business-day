The rand was marginally firmer against the dollar on Monday morning as the greenback’s rally after last week’s US rate hike began to run out of steam. The US Federal Reserve increased the interest rate on Wednesday to 0.75% as expected but the central bank caused some shock waves by forecasting three interest rate hikes in 2017 instead of an expected two, which caused the dollar to strengthen to a 14-year high against its peers. The gold price also took a tumble after the Fed announcement, but has since recovered from a near 11-month low of $1,134.61/oz. Gold is currently trading at $1,142.02/oz. At 8.48am‚ the rand was at R14.0025 against the dollar from the last close at R14.0302. It was at R14.6563 to the euro from R14.6423 and R17.4855 to the pound from R17.5101. The euro was at $1.0467 from $1.0440. Trade is expected to be thin this week with many traders already on leave for the festive period. With little in the way of local market-moving news expected, local markets are likely to take their direction from international markets. Much of the international focus this week will be on the US GDP data for the third quarter and weekly US initial jobless claims, both due for release on Thursday.
