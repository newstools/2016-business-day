There has been a turnaround from the sizeable net outflows over the past two years when South African companies stepped up their efforts to internationalise their businesses.The shift in direct investments trend made a small contribution to improving the financial account of SA&#8217;s balance of payments, which showed a surplus of 3.5% for the third quarter, up from 1.3% the previous quarter. The Reserve Bank&#8217;s quarterly bulletin shows capital inflows were more than adequate to finance the deficit on the current account deficit of the balance of payments, which widened to 4.1% from a revised 2.9% in the third quarter.Economists expect that the current account deficit, which tends to be a driver of the rand exchange rate, will narrow again in the fourth quarter as exports pick up again.
