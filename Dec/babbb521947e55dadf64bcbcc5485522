Osaka &#8212; Percy Tau says Mamelodi Sundowns gave a better performance than the scoreline reflected against the impressive football of Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in the South Koreans&#8217; 4-1 victory at the Fifa Club World Cup (CWC) on Wednesday.Sundowns bowed out of the event in sixth place, having received a lesson in efficiency and quick thinking from the Asian champions.Jeonbuk were always a step ahead of Downs. With an immense work rate they were quicker to the ball.Disappointingly, Sundowns conceded four soft goals, which was as much a factor in the one-sidedness of the defeat as the manner in which the men from Pretoria could not get their midfield and attack functioning in the first half.Coming back from the break 3-0 down, Sundowns improved markedly after Tau scored a candidate for goal of the tournament in the 48th minute.&quot;The scoreline doesn&#8217;t give a true reflection [of our performance]. We tried our best and we did a lot of things better than the previous game,&quot; Tau said.&quot;It was a good game. I think they hit us with the things we expected,&quot; he said.Tau, 22, was singled out for praise by his coach, Pitso Mosimane, as having the ability to compete on any stage.The forward was arguably Sundowns&#8217; man of the match against a Jeonduk who stifled the African champions impressively, but nevertheless struggled to contain Tau.&quot;It&#8217;s good for a player to get good remarks from a coach. And I&#8217;m still where I&#8217;m trying to learn a few things, and I want to get better,&quot; the player said.&quot;And for me to be here at 22 is good also.&quot;Just over a year ago I was at Witbank Spurs not thinking of this moment, because I was in the NFD [National First Division]. You can&#8217;t be in the NFD and think about the Champions League or Club World Cup. First you have to go to the PSL.&quot;When I came back to Sundowns from loan at Spurs that&#8217;s when I thought, &#8216;OK, now I can live my dream&#8217;. Now it&#8217;s happening and I&#8217;m glad to be here.&quot;What Sundowns learnt from the CWC is that even for Japan and Korea, while their sides may have nowhere near the Downs players&#8217; natural ability, the level of competition and level of organisation of the teams in their leagues must be of a high standard. As a result their players think quicker and perform at a higher intensity.Tau said he was not ready to play in a better league where his skills could be sharpened.&quot;I&#8217;m glad with the process so far. I can still get better. And then, who knows?&quot;I just want to get better. And for me it&#8217;s about winning. Because Sundowns has a chance to win the Club World Cup, I can come back here.&quot;Most teams in Europe don&#8217;t come here.&quot;Sundowns left Japan without a win, having lost 2-0 to host club Kashima Antlers in the quarterfinals in their first match.Jeonduk lost 2-1 to Mexico&#8217;s Club America in their quarter.Demonstrating the high competition level that Sundowns had to face in their learning curve at the event, Antlers beat Colombia&#8217;s Atletico Nacional 3-0 in a semifinal of high intensity on Wednesday.
