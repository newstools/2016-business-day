Former president Thabo Mbeki is the new chancellor of the University of SA (Unisa). Mbeki succeeds Judge Bernard Ngoepe, who is retiring. Unisa described Mbeki as "an outstanding African intellectual giant and the most recognisable 21st century proponent of the African Renaissance". The university said Mbeki was "still involved in a range of conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction efforts". The university’s partnership with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation was a "flagship strategic relationship" that had raised Unisa’s global profile as well as leading to "the hosting of the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute‚ the launch of the Thabo Mbeki Presidential Library as well as partnership with the South African Democracy Education Trust". Mbeki’s appointment would "also give impetus to our partnership with the African Union Commission, which was formalised in a memorandum of understanding signed in October 2013". Paying tribute to Ngoepe‚ Unisa said he was a "distinguished legal luminary" who had "selflessly served with integrity‚ dignity and honour". His leadership had enhanced Unisa’s reputation "even during the difficult times of university mergers". TMG Digital
