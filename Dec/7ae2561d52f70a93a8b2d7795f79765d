Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti will appeal against a landmark ruling that ordered his department to appoint a special master to deal with land claims lodged by thousands of labour tenants.The judgment was delivered by the Land Claims Court. The case spanned three years and was brought by four labour tenants and the Association for Rural Advancement because they said the department was failing to process claims.Nkwinti on Sunday said the judgment was "premature"."We were busy implementing a [previous] court order, including the appointment of a senior manager, [but] now the court orders the appointment of a special master before giving the initial court order time to take effect," Nkwinti said. He said the department would appeal.A "special master of labour tenants" will have to produce a plan to implement labour tenant claims to facilitate ownership of farm land in terms of the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act of 1996, according to the judgment delivered last week.The act allows labour tenants to claim ownership of land they, their parents and grandparents lived on and used, but this has not been effected and thousands of applicants have been waiting for their land applications to be processed for over a decade.In the prior judgment, the Land Claims Court ordered the department and the applicants to negotiate a memorandum of understanding, and it ordered the department to appoint a senior manager responsible for managing the national implementation of the act. Negotiations broke down, resulting in the association approaching the court again.The use of a special master is novel in SA, but Judge Thomas Ncube said the concept was similar to that of a family advocate in the US and India.The department said in its papers that a special master would not speed up the land claims process.Association director Laurel Oettle said they were pleased for the thousands of labour tenants and their families whose patience, determination and struggle had been rewarded.The Legal Resources Centre also welcomed the judgment.
