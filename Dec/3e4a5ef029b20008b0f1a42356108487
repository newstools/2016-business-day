Traffic officials trying to combat the annual carnage on SA’s roads over the festive season are endorsing initiatives to seize cellphones from motorists who use their cellphones when driving — and to fine them R2‚000. The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said on Tuesday it supported municipal initiatives to improve compliance with the rules of the road by confiscating cellular phones and imposing heavy fines on motorists who drove without driver’s licences. "In our quest to decisively deal with lawlessness on the roads and promote safety‚ we unequivocally and without any reservation support the initiatives taken by certain municipalities to enforce bylaws that seek to promote compliance with the rules of the road and change human behaviour‚ in particular the confiscation of cellular phones used while driving and the payment of R2‚000 fine for the [reclaiming] of such equipment‚" RTMC CEO Makhosini Msibi said. The RTMC also supported the arrest of those driving without licences and the imposition of a R1‚000 fine‚ he said. "The initiative and enforcement of by-laws by the municipalities is laudable and we call upon the justice cluster to come to the party and support the reclassification of the Criminal Procedure Act, in particular offences relating to drunken driving‚ speeding‚ negligent and reckless driving and other related offences. "It is time that we decisively take steps and measures aimed at promoting safety on our roads and preserving lives. The same initiative and vigor should be applied to jaywalking, which has been shown as one of the major causes of crashes and fatalities on the roads‚" Msibi said. TMG Digital
