The ever more conflictual relationship between the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and its parent ministry cannot be good for SARS as an institution or for the country and its public purse.Until President Jacob Zuma appointed Tom Moyane as SARS commissioner in 2014, the revenue service had always had a close and more than cordial relationship with the finance minister and the Treasury.That close working relationship is a crucial one if the Treasury is to be apprised accurately of the tax trends and tax issues, enabling it to shape appropriate policy and to forecast revenue collections accurately &mdash; the revenue collections that enable the government to spend hundreds of billions of rand each year on social services and economic infrastructure to support SA&rsquo;s growth and development.That close relationship is crucial, too, if SARS is to be set revenue targets by the Treasury which it can achieve and if it is then to be supported in its efforts to achieve those, and be made accountable for any failures or flaws.But this vital relationship has largely broken down since Moyane&rsquo;s arrival, which was followed by a series of suspensions of senior staff and the start of the highly damaging saga of the purported "rogue unit", as well as with Moyane&rsquo;s launch of a far-reaching restructuring programme &mdash; a programme that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan made it clear did not have his blessing.Since then things have gone from bad to worse and recent events around now suspended second-in-command Jonas Makwakwa and around the formation of a new rogue-style unit have raised some serious question marks about SARS&rsquo;s governance and management.The conflict between the revenue service and the finance minister came into the open again this week when Gordhan qualified his answers to parliamentary questions about SARS, particularly about its new investigative unit. He stated that he couldn&rsquo;t vouch for the information that had been supplied by SARS, and in retaliation the service has now issued a media release.This is unedifying stuff, which can only be bad for an institution that relies on its credibility and integrity and reputation among taxpayers to ensure that it can collect the taxes that are owed and can meet its targets.At a time when the economy is weak and consumers and companies are stretched, an effective and highly regarded SARS is even more important if SA s virtuous tax culture is to be sustained. And with tens of senior and experienced people having left SARS, or having been booted out of the service in the past two years, it has surely become even more challenging for the institution to deliver what SA expects. This is particularly so since the world has become a lot more global and the really big tax evaders ever more creative.All this points to the urgent need for clarity on how SARS is to be governed and managed. It suggests, too, that we need a robust oversight body that can take the politics and any and all corruption out of SARS and can ensure that the interests of taxpayers and of SA are properly served by the institution.Fortunately, the tax advisory committee chaired by Judge Dennis Davis is busy with a study on tax administration to complement its studies on tax policy. It is looking at exactly that question of how to ensure SA has a revenue service that is adequate to the task.The Davis committee is looking at international precedents for best practice on the governance and oversight of tax authorities, as well as on how they should operate, and what kind of capacity they should have to ensure they are on top of complex tax issues. We look forward to seeing its findings sooner rather than later.
