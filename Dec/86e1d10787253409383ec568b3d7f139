The rand was slightly firmer on Friday morning ahead of S&P Global Ratings’ credit assessment of the country later in the evening. S&P has SA rated at just one notch above sub-investment grade, with a negative outlook. But many analysts believe a downgrade to so-called junk status is unlikely. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana said it was a close call but she did not expect S&P to downgrade the country’s rating. S&P is the last of the leading agencies to report on SA’s debt for the year. Moody’s Investors Service left SA’s rating two notches above junk and Fitch lowered its outlook to negative from stable but maintained its investment grade rating Ramkhelawan-Bhana said S&P was "comfortable" with October's medium-term budget and local politics was no worse than it was in June. She said that if the agency did downgrade SA’s rating, the market could expect an aggressive reaction. Standard Bank trader Inshaan Omar said that the market could expect a "fairly mundane" morning with the fireworks kicking off after 3:30pm when US nonfarm payrolls would be released. At 8.28am, the rand was at R14.0639 to the dollar from Thursday’s R14.0973. It was at R15.0241 to the euro from R15.0288 and R17.7473 to the pound from R17.7608 The euro was at $1.0682 from $1.0660.
