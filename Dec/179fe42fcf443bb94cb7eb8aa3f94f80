Staff costs and insourcing are driving universities to institute a maximum 8% fee hike in 2017 to plug widening deficits fuelled by falling state subsidies.The University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Stellenbosch have both announced that they would implement the 8% fee increase in 2017, pitting themselves against an angry student body calling for free education.Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, the University of Cape Town and the University of KwaZulu-Natal are set to make their fee announcements later this week.Stellenbosch University is also going to hike residence rates 10%.Both Wits and Stellenbosch said poor students and those who came from middle-income families would be exempted from the fee hikes. Students who fall in these categories will be subsidised by a state top-up.Stellenbosch council chairman George Steyn said the university had "no other option" but to increase fees to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the institution.The government released more funds in the mid-term budget review, and a further 43% was added to baseline funding for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, but this is not enough to keep universities operating optimally.Steyn said: "We deliver sought-after graduates, maintain a high research output and provide innovative student support services. Whereas the average first-year throughput rate in SA is 50%, more than 85% of our students progress to their second year."Adequate funding is a prerequisite to sustain such support, which in turn assists our students to complete their studies. In that way, the institution helps students keep their study costs as low as possible."Wits, which announced its hike on Monday, cited escalating academic, professional and administrative staff costs, as well as its need to acquire new books, pay for journal subscriptions, utilities and infrastructure.The added cost of insourcing and the information and communications technology renewal project would take up the bulk of funds, said spokeswoman Shirona Patel.Insourcing was one of the demands made by students in the #FeesMustFall movement, as well as by workers.Patel said the 8% increase for 2017 would not be enough to cover an expected R56.5m deficit. The university would have to go on an intensive fundraising drive.The University of Cape Town s council would meet on Saturday to determine a way forward on fees, said spokeswoman Pat Lucas.Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University s council will have a sitting on Friday to decide on a fee structure for 2017.
