Seoul &mdash; South Korean President Park Geun-hye has called members of her cabinet for a meeting at 8am GMT on Friday, the Yonhap news agency said.South Korea&rsquo;s parliament passed a motion to impeach Park on Friday over an influence-peddling scandal that could lead to her becoming South Korea&rsquo;s first democratically elected leader to be removed from office.There have been mass rallies every Saturday for the past six weeks calling for Park to quit, and opinion polls show overwhelming public support for her impeachment.The National Assembly motion &mdash; passed by 234 votes to 56 &mdash; transfers Park&rsquo;s authority to the prime minister, pending a decision by the Constitutional Court on whether to ratify the decision and permanently remove the president from office.Reuters and AFP
