Singapore — Oil prices eased on Tuesday as traders began to unwind positions in the run-up to the year-end holiday season. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were trading at $51.97 a barrel at 1.34am GMT, down 15c from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down 1c from their last close at $54.91 a barrel. Traders said the slight dip was a result of market players squaring their books ahead of the upcoming Christmas weekend and the week running up to New Year, during which many offices would be shut. Analysts said they expected markets to remain tepid this week, with no fundamentals expected that could drive large price swings. "With little data due, prices are likely to drift aimlessly in today’s session," ANZ bank said. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda brokerage in Singapore, said "a light news week and the run-in to the holiday season" was keeping markets quiet. Reuters
