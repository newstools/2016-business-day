This is believed to be a large contributing factor to the expected growth within this industry&sbquo; as more individuals become educated on the drought&sbquo; and look to put in place measures to reduce their water usage. Those individuals and businesses that operate within this [ambit] will more than likely be experiencing growth&sbquo; and looking to expand within [the first quarter] to keep up with demand&sbquo;" said Van den Barselaar."Meanwhile&sbquo; the growth in the restaurants and hotels sector is related to the amount of local and international tourists and holiday makers making use of local facilities in order to take advantage of the South African summer."When compared with the fourth quarter of 2016&sbquo; hiring intentions strengthen in five of the 10 industry sectors.
