Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride has challenged Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi to take a polygraph test after Mokotedi accused McBride of attempting to assassinate him.Mokotedi laid charges on Monday against McBride, investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan, former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya and suspended crime intelligence agent Candice Coetzee, accusing them of plotting to assassinate him and national Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza.McBride described the allegations as: "Yet another desperate attempt to implicate me and others in wrongdoing &ndash; which attempt can never succeed."He said Mokotedi&rsquo;s allegations were one of many unsuccessful attempts to bring fabricated cases against him and his colleagues since he took up his position as the head of Ipid.He challenged Mokotedi to a polygraph test on live TV."Paul O Sullivan has provided credible information to the Ipid. It is notable that matters that were reported by him against generals Ntlemeza and [Khomotso] Phahlane, while I was on suspension, were never investigated by Ipid. On my return I ordered that they be investigated. That is why there is this pushback," McBride said.In an affidavit published by Eye Witness News, Mokotedi said a source had told him that McBride held a meeting in Bedfordview with Sibiya, O Sullivan, lobby group AfriForum and the DA to plot against individuals close to President Jacob Zuma. Other people the group planned to target included National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams and State Security Agency head Arthur Fraser."The attendees agreed that Mr Paul O Sullivan should collect information and dig dirt that would implicate [the individuals] in any kind of transgressions, especially on corruption and other acts of criminality," Mokotedi said.Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed that Mokotedi had laid eight charges at the Bedfordview Police Station against McBride and the other three. The charges included high treason, conspiracy to commit murder, espionage and corruption.DA police spokesman Zakhele Mbhele said: "Prince Mokotedi s allegations against Robert McBride are very serious and they must be properly investigated to arrive at the truth so that there can be no doubt about the integrity of our investigation agencies."However, he said that if the charges were part of the ongoing war to capture the security cluster then anyone behind them must be held accountable under the law.Mbhele blamed Police Minister Nathi Nhleko for politicising the police portfolio."His previous wars against the politically inconvenient have created a climate for internecine war," Mbhele said.AfriForum and Nhleko spokesman Sandile Ngidi could not be reached for comment.
