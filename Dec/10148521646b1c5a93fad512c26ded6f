The DA has called for the R17.3m reportedly paid to PetroSA&rsquo;s top executives to be paid back immediately, and says the legal opinion that informed this disastrous payment must be made public and tabled before Parliament.The Sunday Times revealed on Sunday that the cash-strapped state-owned entity paid 11 executives a total of R17.3m in bonuses&sbquo; even though these bonuses were not approved by PetroSA&rsquo;s board.The bonuses were paid out based on a legal opinion which stated that "affordability would not qualify as a justifiable reason to not pay the bonuses".They were paid the bonuses despite the entity reporting a record loss blamed largely on the failed Ikhwezi gas-drilling project, Business Day reported last month.The DA s spokesman on energy matters Gordon Mackay said what was disturbing was that this opinion was obtained by PetroSA s head of legal services Mokgaetsi Sebothoma who reportedly received a R2.4m payout."The payment of bonuses to executives comes at a time when the state oil company recorded an immense loss of R14.5bn due to a number of disastrous projects and failure to meet key targets," Mackay said."In light of austerity measures and the fact that PetroSA staff members have not received bonuses for two years it is manifestly unfair for executives many of whom have overseen failed projects and have not met targets to receive millions in bonuses."We cannot afford a culture in state-owned entities where poor decisions and lack of accountability by top executives are rewarded with the payment of astronomical bonuses."Disgruntled mid-level employees accused their bosses of running a "self-enrichment scheme" and have approached the CCMA, the Sunday Times Reported. They are also planning protests.Executives rewarded for their poor performances include Andrew Dippenaar, manager of geosciences and data, paid R2.3m despite the Ikhwezi project to explore for gas off Mossel Bay missing its targets. He oversaw the project and was suspended for nine months due to the board s unhappiness about it.Sebothoma s R2.4m payment was despite leading the failed Project Irene. an attempt to buy petrol retailer Engen s operations.Read the full Sunday Times story here.TMG Digital with Sunday Times and Business Day
