An international survey of schoolchildren&rsquo;s maths and science competency has told us that South African children perform on average at no more than 60% of the level of those in the world&rsquo;s top performer, Singapore.The latest results from the global Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) show that our grade 5 and 9 pupils still score far below 400 when the TIMSS centre point is 500 and countries such as Singapore are at about 600 or more.That is a shocker, whichever way you look at it. No wonder South African matriculants struggle when they get to university, where the average throughput rate is not even 50%. No wonder there is such a small pool of matriculants with decent maths and science marks from which SA can draw its future doctors, scientists, engineers, accountants and other professionals. No wonder SA is so afflicted by a dearth of skills &mdash; and that so many of its young people are profoundly handicapped in the modern, hi-tech world of work.True, there is some upside amid the gloom. SA&rsquo;s scores have improved &mdash; so much so that it has shown the largest improvement of all the countries surveyed between 2003 and 2015, or 87 points in maths and 90 points in science.The fact that SA surveyed grades 5 and 9 this time, so the learners were a full year ahead of the grade 4s and 8s surveyed the previous times, surely flattered the results.And we are improving off an extremely low base, so our grade 5 performance in maths, for example, still scores just 376 where third-ranked Korea, for example, scores 608. And the science scores are even worse.Even so, the heavy positive spin about "green shoots" put on the TIMSS results by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga had some merit. And, encouragingly, policy makers do seem to be using the survey as a platform to try to set realistic targets to improve maths and science outcomes, as well as to try to get to the bottom of why so many learners do so badly.There is much rich information in the research that has been done in SA to support the TIMSS survey. It draws attention to the importance of early childhood education, an area in which the government has been spending quite a lot of money &mdash; but, as it turns out, not necessarily effectively.The research shows good early childhood education makes a big difference to how well children do in maths and science if they are in better-off schools, but doesn t help that much at the poorest end of the scale.There is much data too, not surprisingly, on how much better children do if they come from homes with books, or with running water.But the South African results show, too, just how much better pupils do in some provinces than others and how very unequal the outcomes are. And that goes to the heart of the problem of the way the minister and her team chose to present the TIMSS results.It is fair enough to point to inequality and poor cultural capital at home and at playschool as reasons for why so many children, particularly poorer children from poorer provinces, do so badly in the two key "gateway" subjects of maths and science. Policy needs to address that too, and of course it must address infrastructure needs at schools, especially in areas such as toilets and sanitation.But in the end, Motshekga and her colleagues in the government and in the trade unions cannot get away from the fact that the still terrible TIMSS results are fundamentally about the failure of SA s schools and their management and the parlous and fractious state of its teaching profession. Until they are willing to take bold action to address that, SA may continue to hug the bottom of the TIMSS table.
