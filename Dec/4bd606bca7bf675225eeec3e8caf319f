Global gold miner AngloGold Ashanti will increase annualised gold output from its 70%-owned Tropicana mine in Australia to between 450,000 and 490,000 ounces from the second half of next year as it makes changes to mining and processing, it said on Thursday.In the first nine months of this year Tropicana produced 296,000oz.This is the first mine that AngloGold discovered and built outside SA, but management has highlighted at recent presentations that its volumes and operating costs are a concern. The joint venture partner is Independence Group.AngloGold said a programme to address declining production was showing success, with the throughput capacity at the plant rising to 7.5-million tonnes/year from 5.8-million tonnes/year and the introduction of a 600 tonne shovel to accelerate mining rates.It said gold production could accelerate beyond 490,000oz/year depending on the outcome of the Long Island Study, which was based on strip mining the depth extensions of the mineralised system and backfilling the waste into the Tropicana void. This would reduce the cost of mining waste because haulage would be along shorter, horizontal routes instead of long uphill routes to the waste dump using conventional mining.This study should be completed in the second quarter of next year and if this mining method is used, the first cutback would be made in 2019.AngloGold said it had conducted further exploratory drilling around the current deposit, which had increased the known ore reserves by 45% and the ore resource by 27%.
