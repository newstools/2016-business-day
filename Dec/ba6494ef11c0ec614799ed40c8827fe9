The economy has endured severe shocks in the past few years. At last, however, the business cycle appears to be bottoming out amid expectations that SA will enjoy better growth and lower inflation in 2017.The Reuters consensus is for real GDP growth to recover, from about 0.4% in 2016, to 1.1% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. This improvement hinges on the expectation that the waning drought will cause food inflation to fall, dragging headline consumer price inflation lower. This will raise consumers&rsquo; disposable income and spending, driving an upturn in GDP growth.Over the past two years, agricultural output has contracted by double digits and food price inflation has trebled, from about 4% in mid-2015 to 12% today. This has hit all consumers hard, especially low-income households."The increase in summer rainfall suggests that SA should experience a very welcome improvement in the agricultural season ahead," said Stanlib economist Kevin Lings."This should lead to a meaningful moderation in food inflation during 2017, which, in turn, will help to bring headline consumer inflation back inside the target range within the next six months."The jury is still out on whether consumer inflation has already peaked and whether the Reserve Bank has reached the end of its hiking cycle. The Reuters consensus is for the repo rate to be kept flat at 7% during 2017.But much will depend on the behaviour of the rand, especially in response to US fiscal policy. Should the Federal Reserve hike rates more aggressively than expected, the Reserve Bank may be forced to respond in order to shield SA from the inflationary effects of a weaker rand.The other prop to growth is likely to be found in firmer commodity prices, which would feed into better export prospects, provided global growth is maintained.After a five-year bull run driven largely by Chinese growth, commodity prices reached a cyclical low at the start of 2016. Since then, most have recovered from their lows as producers have cut back on supply. Prices are expected to keep firming into the new year.So although faster, sustainable growth still eludes SA, inflation expectations have softened, commodity prices appear to be firming, and both business and consumer confidence have recently lifted off the bottom in anticipation of better times ahead.Also encouraging is that SA s leading economic indicator has risen in three out of the past four months, pointing towards firming rather than falling growth in 2017.To drive sustainable growth, SA needs a resurgence in fixed investment by companies the kind of investment that creates jobs and grows exports.These are some of the big-ticket items that will be watched closely in 2017.Should the state move more decisively on structural reforms, the pace of growth could surprise on the upside.
