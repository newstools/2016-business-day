The JSE suspended Middle East Diamond Resources listing on Tuesday after the company failed to convince the bourse to let it continue trading following an auditor&rsquo;s disclaimer in its latest annual results."Having considered those representations the JSE has decided to suspend the listing of the issuer," the bourse said. The company was formerly called Sable Metals and Minerals.The JSE asked Middle East Diamond for a written response as to why its listing should not be suspended after the company&rsquo;s auditors changed its opinion on the company in the October 4 release of annual results.Middle East Diamond, which has no cash-generating assets, had agreed to a monthly injection of cash from a major shareholder and had warned shareholders it was impairing a platinum metals prospecting right.The auditors noted: "The opinion changed from the reviewed results due to the prospecting rights not being renewed by the Department of Minerals at date of the audit opinion where the likelihood of the renewal of the right at the date of the review conclusion was greater."The inconsistent payment of the R450,000 payment agreed upon between the parties since the reviewed results also had the implication of change in audit opinion."In the note accompanying the annual results to end-February this year and released in October, Middle East Diamonds said it had expenditure of about R450,000 a month but had no revenue generation.The majority shareholder had agreed to make a monthly payment of R450,000 to cover costs but "regular payments have not been made by the majority shareholder as agreed upon".Middle East Diamond had issued shares to buy the Kamfersdam dumps near Kimberley to source diamonds but the company had no documentation and had not completed a due-diligence study by the end of its financial year to tell shareholders what value could be realised from these dumps.One of Middle East Diamond s prospecting rights in Gauteng expired on December 3 this year and another will expire on April 29 next year "thereafter the group has no registered mining or prospecting rights from which to generate revenue".Middle East Diamond said it had submitted a number of prospecting rights applications with the department and had applied to renew expired prospecting right it had impaired."The application process with the Department of Minerals is a lengthy process and uncertainty exists whether the rights will be granted or renewed," it said.At the end of February, the company had current assets of R614,000, with cash of R401,000 while current liabilities stood at R3.1m.
