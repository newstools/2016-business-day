The rand was stronger against the dollar at midday on Monday, continuing to benefit from the reprieve S&P Global Ratings gave the country on Friday night. The agency decided to maintain its rating of SA’s foreign currency debt at one level above noninvestment grade, or junk status, but lowered the local currency rating one notch. Fitch Ratings and S&P had the country on negative outlook, which indicates that SA not out of the woods yet, according to some analysts. Andre Botha, a currency dealer at TreasuryOne, said the general feeling was that the can had been kicked down the road only until June 2017, when S&P is expected to downgrade SA’s foreign-currency rating to junk. The rand was steady against the euro after Italians voted against a constitutional reform proposal on Sunday. The Italian referendum was set to dominate global focus on Monday, according to Botha, so any news out of Italy would have an effect on the Euro. The euro seems to have recovered against the dollar for the time being, regaining some of the loss it made once the outcome of the Italian referendum was clear. At 11.31am, the rand was at R13.8260 to the dollar from Friday’s R13.8844. It was at R14.7167 to the euro from R14.7065 and R17.5952 to the pound from R17.5367 The euro was at $1.0644 from $1.0631.
