A group of ANC veterans who met party leaders over the state of the organisation have welcomed the decision to hold a consultative conference but have expressed concern at the outcomes of last weekend’s national executive committee (NEC) meeting. The stalwarts said they had received a report back from their meeting with the ANC and would be meeting ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe again on Monday. "The stalwarts welcome the statement from the extended NEC ... that there will be a consultative conference," they said in a statement on Friday. "However, there are a number of the reported outcomes of the NEC and our previous discussions with the NWC [national working committee] that will require clarification and careful consideration at the meeting between the stalwarts and the SGO [secretary general’s office] on Monday." The veterans met the national working committee twice last week ahead of the three-day national executive committee meeting, which saw the ANC debate the future of President Jacob Zuma as the leader of the country. During the meeting with the national working committee, the veterans proposed that the ANC hold a consultative conference ahead of its 2017 elective conference where Zuma’s successor would be elected. Mantashe on Tuesday said the ANC national executive committee had decided to extend next year’s policy conference by one day. The first two days of the conference would be spent on assessing the state of the ANC. The policy conference would be held from June 30 to July 5. "The meeting held with the veterans affirmed that the party can’t be strong unless it works together for unity and cohesion," he said. The veterans have said they would preside over the consultative conference, which would "reflect on all aspects of the state of the organisation" and where the ANC would discuss the "election of credible leaders — free of blemishes, factionalism and corruption".
