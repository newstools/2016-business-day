Brent advanced a further 1.74% to $52.31/barrel and West Texas Intermediate 1.67% to $49.81/barrel ahead of the JSE’s opening.

November’s new vehicle sales are scheduled for release at 11am on Thursday from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA. Trading Economics forecast a drop to 47,364 from October’s 48,745 units. "Weaker rates of credit extension to households has been a restraining factor on new passenger vehicle sales. Affordability has been additionally affected by substantial increases in new car prices, on the lagged effects of past rand depreciation. New passenger vehicle sales were 11.2% lower in October than the same month the previous year and the November reading is likely to reflect a continued underperformance in sales," Investec Bank economist Kamilla Kaplan wrote in her weekly economics note. The Barclays sponsored purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for November is scheduled for release at 11am. Trading Economics expects it to have improved slightly to 46.2 points from October’s 45.9 points. "In November, the manufacturing PMI gauge is likely to have remained below the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction. The October PMI survey signaled a deterioration of conditions in the sector at the start of the fourth quarter. Although some respondents had experienced an increase in export orders, domestic demand was deemed as particularly weak," Kaplan wrote.
