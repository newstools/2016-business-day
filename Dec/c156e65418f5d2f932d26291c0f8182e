Both the Financial Services Board (FSB) and its former deputy pension funds registrar Rosemary Hunter came in for some flak on Wednesday for their handling of the litigation surrounding the FSB&rsquo;s controversial cancellations project.Hunter, whose contract with the FSB expired in July, took her then-employer to court in January. She sought to obtain access to two reports investigating the manner in which the registrations of more than 4,600 pension funds &mdash; that were "orphaned" as they did not have a board of trustees, or were shells lacking assets and liabilities &mdash; were cancelled.She had initially raised the alarm with the FSB, saying it appeared the cancellations were conducted outside the powers of the registrar of pension funds.The board of the regulator commissioned retired judge Kate O&rsquo;Regan to investigate the matter, but O&rsquo;Regan asked for a forensic audit to complete her report. KPMG was duly appointed to conduct the audit.She also sought an order compelling the finance minister to look into her "notices of noncompliance" against FSB boss Dube Tshidi.In dismissing the case on the grounds Hunter had failed to adequately set out her cause of action, Judge Hendrik Jacobs referred to the acrimonious nature of the litigation, which arose mainly from "employment issues"."All the parties to the litigation except the minister are to blame for the state of affairs. Having regard to the nature of the employment issues reasonable litigants would have terminated the litigation."He said that the finance minister had offered Hunter permission to withdraw her application with freedom from punishment.After the ruling, Hunter said she would study the judgment to determine how to proceed.The FSB welcomed the ruling. "Today s ruling follows a lengthy and exhaustive process during which the FSB defended itself against serious allegations by Hunter," said spokesman Tembisa Marele."The FSB finds it unfortunate that this difference of opinion resulted in a long and costly court case, as the board at all times pursued a proactive process of achieving clarity on such issues.""The FSB s endeavours to get rid of [Hunter] at all cost, first by way of a golden handshake and later by way of a failed disciplinary process, fuelled the applicant s efforts to pursue what she perceives as a quest for justice from which the general public would benefit."She retaliated with a process of suspicion-mongering against Tshidi. The FSB chose to deny [Hunter] access to the O Regan report and the KPMG report which were both produced as a direct consequence of the applicant s concern. The conduct of the FSB gave rise to the litigation or at least part of it," Jacobs said.
