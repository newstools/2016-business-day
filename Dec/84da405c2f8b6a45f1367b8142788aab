The ANC in the West Rand is calling on Mogale City to quickly convene a council meeting and elect a new mayor who can immediately take the lead in stabilising the city. The comment follows the resignation on Thursday of the DA mayor Lynn Pannall‚ because of ill health. The ANC lost control of the municipality in the local government election in August. Although the ANC obtained a majority of the vote, at 48.81%, the smaller parties pooled their votes and elected Pannall to lead the municipality. On Friday, the ANC accused her of failing "dismally" to govern. "Since the local government elections in August 2016‚ governance and service delivery have collapsed in the city. This clearly shows the inability of the DA/EFF coalition to run the municipality‚" the ANC said in a statement. The DA had been "clueless" in fulfilling its governance obligations in its first 100 days. "As a result‚ the executive under this administration could not address the community of Mogale on the recent water crisis," the ANC said. "Additionally‚ the amateurish DA failed to present quarterly reports to the council as required by the law." The ANC said it was not in the best interest of South Africans to have incompetent leadership‚ and thereby fail them in delivering crucial services. The Mogale region‚ with an estimated 100‚000 people‚ is one of the poorest in Gauteng. On August 18‚ Pannall gave the DA its first municipality in the province when she was sworn in as the new mayor after winning by just one vote. The ANC retained the positions of speaker and chief whip. TMG Digital
