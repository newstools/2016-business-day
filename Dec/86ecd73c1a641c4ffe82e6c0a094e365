Singapore &mdash; Oil prices fell on Wednesday following a reported rise in US crude inventories and an estimate that oil cartel Opec may have produced more crude in November than previously thought, potentially undermining a planned output cut.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were down 69c, or 1.3%, to $52.29 a barrel at 4.30am GMT.International Brent crude futures were down 69c, or 1.2%, at $55.03 a barrel.Traders said the price falls followed a report of surprise increases in US crude inventories. Markets were also focused on an expected US interest rate hike, probably supporting the dollar and making dollar-traded fuel imports more expensive for countries using other currencies at home."Momentum continues to wane in oil markets with both Brent and WTI slightly lower overnight, following higher than expected API [American Petroleum Institute] inventory numbers in the US ... [which] showed an unexpectedly large increase of 4.7-million barrels," Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley said."We expect Asian trading to have a slightly negative bias as traders trim longs into the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s main event this evening," he added, referring to the expected decision later on Wednesday by the US central bank to hike interest rates.Greg McKenna, chief market strategist foreign exchange and futures brokerage AxiTrader said "traders pretty much have a Fed increase of 25 basis points locked and loaded".Oil traders said prices were further depressed by a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that said it believed that Middle East producer club Opec pumped about 34.2-million barrels a day of crude in November, 500,000 barrels a day above Opec&rsquo;s official estimate, which was already a record.If correct, that would undermine the effort by Opec and non-Opec producers like Russia to cut almost 1.8-million barrels a day of production in a bid to end two years of oversupply and cheap oil.The agency said global oil supply rose to a record 98.2-million barrels a day in November, as Opec production offset declines elsewhere.This stands against expectations of 96.95-million barrels a day of global oil demand for the fourth quarter of 2016.Despite this, the IEA said that due to firm demand increases, the oil market could show a shortfall of 600,000 barrels a day early next year if producers stuck to their reduction plans.Reuters
