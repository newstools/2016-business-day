Steve Komphela remained defiant about his tenure at Kaizer Chiefs after Saturday&rsquo;s loss in Port Elizabeth, suggesting he is determined to fight on as coach even though speculation over his future heightened after the defeat to Chippa United."I have never given up in my life&sbquo;" the 49-year-old Chiefs coach said in reply to a question about whether he believed he was still the man to lead the club after an eighth successive match without a victory."I have to stay calm and take the punches that is a job of the coach. Who else must be punched? I must stand and be strong. I will only waver the minute I feel the pressure that should be on me is now getting to my players " he said after the 3-1 defeat at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Komphela said Chiefs had defended badly and gave too much space behind their left back. "It was always going to be a tough ask because Chippa play good football. We had a good first half and we had a chance to make it 2-0."It is no matter how good you play, but if you don t defend, it can prove costly.TMG Digital
