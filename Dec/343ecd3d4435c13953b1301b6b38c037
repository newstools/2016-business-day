Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s lawyer‚ Zola Majavu‚ said he advised his client that‚ until he is informed to the contrary‚ he should not to report for duty at the SABC. Majavu was speaking following the judgment in the High Court in Cape Town on Monday that set aside the disciplinary proceedings against Motsoeneng last year and ordered that the SABC commence new proceedings against him. It also set aside the decision taken in September to appoint Motsoeneng as the SABC’s group executive of corporate affairs. The court also declared that‚ unless and until the negative findings against Motsoeneng in the public protector’s 2014 report were reviewed and set aside‚ or unless and until Motsoeneng was exonerated from the negative findings by way of a valid disciplinary hearing‚ Motsoeneng may not hold any position at the SABC. The public protector’s report made various adverse findings about Motsoeneng‚ including that he committed fraud by stating in his application form for employment that he had completed matric. Majavu‚ speaking to SAfm on Tuesday morning‚ said he wrote to the SABC on Monday night asking for clarity on what the employer intended to do. The SABC had not yet responded to his letter‚ Majavu said. "There is nothing in the court order that he is no longer an employee of the SABC‚" Majavu said. Majavu indicated that he would consult Motsoeneng on Tuesday. TMG Digital
