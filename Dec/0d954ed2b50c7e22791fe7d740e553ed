Sibanye Gold&rsquo;s appetite for platinum and gold remains undiminished as it makes a R30bn friendly takeover bid for US palladium and platinum miner Stillwater Mining Company. It seeks to issue shares for up to $1bn to give it firepower for more deals, says Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman.Froneman, who is easily the most prolific dealmaker in SA&rsquo;s mining industry, said at Friday&rsquo;s unveiling of the Stillwater deal, which needs shareholder approval from both companies and regulatory clearance, that Sibanye wanted to add refining capacity to its South African platinum business as well as to add a sizeable amount of gold production to its portfolio.Sibanye&rsquo;s board was considering a separate chrome division that could form the core of its entrance into base metals, he said in an interview.Catching many in the market off-guard, Sibanye launched the $2.2bn cash bid for Stillwater, the US&rsquo;s only platinum group metal (PGM) producer and the largest source of the metals outside SA and Russia. The deal &mdash; highlighting Sibanye&rsquo;s bet that prices for PGMs would bottom out after years of stagnation &mdash; will give it refining capacity and a better understanding of the marketing side of the PGM business. It spreads the geographical risk away from its focus on SA and Zimbabwe, two uncertain countries for mining.One-third of its PGM production would be from the US."While Sibanye has employed mergers and acquisitions to diversify away from gold in the last 12 months into platinum, interestingly this transaction represents its first outside of SA and, based on the price paid for Stillwater, the market value of its South African and US assets will come close to 50:50," JP Morgan Cazenove said in a note on Friday.The deal would be funded with a $2.7bn bridging loan organised by Citi and HSBC. The loan would be repaid from cash holdings, debt and a bond, and a rights issue of $750m-$1bn once the Stillwater deal was concluded in the second quarter of 2017, Froneman said.Large Amount of DebtThe deal would put a large amount of debt on Sibanye&rsquo;s balance sheet, but Froneman told investors and analysts this would be reduced by the end of 2017 to manageable levels with proceeds from the rights issue."If it is successful in achieving this leverage target, Sibanye&rsquo;s combination of high-quality gold and platinum assets spanning SA and North American, plus a well-capitalised balance sheet, would be an attractive investment proposition in our view," JP Morgan said.By raising more than $750m in the rights issue, Sibanye would replenish its war chest and would be ready for another deal in gold or platinum, Froneman said.Asked in the interview whether the company was growing too quickly and whether his management teams and balance sheet were stretched too thin, he said: "There does come a point when you re not ready for growth, but we ve made sure we have sufficient capacity in the company. We have been criticised for having too many executives for the size of our company, but it s for exactly this type of growth without taking focus away from the operating side of our business."The 15% decline in Sibanye s share price on Friday, far outpacing its JSE-listed gold peers, was to be expected because the market was factoring in the rights issue, the quantum and pricing of which would be made known in about four months time, Froneman said.
