The South African bond market was firmer on Thursday before midday‚ in tandem with a stronger rand. Bonds frequently track the rand. The rand, which strengthened on the back of a weaker dollar and increased global demand for commodities, was at R13.6835 to the dollar from Wednesday’s close of R13.8382. Dow Jones Newswires reported that the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against 16 other currencies, was down 0.2% after Wednesday’s disappointing pending home sales data. It said the dollar index had hit its highest level since 2002 but market participants would be making adjustments for longer dollar positions ahead of next year. At 11.37am, the benchmark R186 bid was bid at 8.920% from Wednesday’s 8.955% while the R207 was at 8.130% from 8.175%.
