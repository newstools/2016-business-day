After more than two years battling debilitating drought, the iSimangaliso Wetlands Park is ready to welcome visitors to the area once again. Recent heavy rains could not have come at a better time, CEO Andrew Zaloumis says. The park was in dire straits, uncertain whether its animals would survive another season of heat and falling water levels. But water levels in the Lake St Lucia system have risen dramatically, he says, with strong inflows from the uMfolozi River into Lake St Lucia. "With 90% of the lake’s surface area now covered, the lake is once again a single body of water — no longer compartmentalised, and joined via the Narrows to the mouth," he says. "The direct rainfall and flow from other rivers such as the uMkhuze, uMzinene, Hluhluwe and Nyalazi, is also providing much-needed relief to the northern sections of the lake." Zaloumis said during the drought the park had discouraged visitors from coming, but now more than 40,000 visitors are expected this festive season alone. In December 1999 the 332,000ha iSimangaliso Wetland Park became SA’s first United Nations World Heritage Site. It has three lake systems, eight interlinking ecosystems, 700-year-old fishing traditions, most of SA’s remaining swamp forests, Africa’s largest estuarine system, 526 bird species and 25,000-year-old vegetated coastal dunes that are among the highest in the world. The park’s 220km of beach stretch from Maphelane in the south to Kosi Bay on the Mozambique border.
