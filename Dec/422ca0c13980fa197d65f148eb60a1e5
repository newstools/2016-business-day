Zurich — Arsenal will have another chance to beat Bayern Munich in a Champions League knockout tie after the sides were paired yet again in the round of 16 following Monday’s draw. The teams met at the same stage in 2005, 2013 and 2014 with the German champions winning on all three occasions. Paris St Germain will also try to break a jinx when they face Spanish champions Barcelona, who knocked them out in the quarterfinals in 2013 and 2014. Holders Real Madrid, who like Bayern finished as runners-up in their group and will therefore play the first leg at home, were given a tricky clash with Serie A side Napoli. The draw also produced a potential grudge match as it pitted Bayer Leverkusen against Atletico Madrid, whose respective coaches Roger Schmidt and Diego Simeone were involved in an ugly touchline spat when the sides met two seasons ago. Arsenal may feel this could be their best chance to beat Bayern, whose domestic and European form has not been as dominant as in recent seasons. "We are through to the knockout stage for the 14th consecutive season, which is testament to Arsene Wenger and the teams throughout that time," club secretary David Miles said. Serie A champions Juventus were drawn against Porto in a repeat of the 1984 European Cup Winners’ Cup final. Sevilla will meet English champions Leicester, Manchester City will take on AS Monaco, and Benfica of Portugal will play Borussia Dortmund. Reuters
