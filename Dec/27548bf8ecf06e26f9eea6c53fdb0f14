A Gwede Mantashe-led ANC delegation spent hours on Tuesday locked in a meeting behind closed doors with leaders of the African Independent Congress (AIC) at the Alfred Nzo district municipal chambers in eMaxesibeni (formerly Mount Ayliff).The meeting started before 11am and carried on until late afternoon. Mantashe was joined by senior ANC provincial executive committee members in the Eastern Cape including Sakhumzi Somyo, Helen Sauls-August and Fikile Xasa.While the media was allowed to take photos inside the council chambers, journalists were forbidden from witnessing the discussions.ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa, who was part of the meeting, said it was meant to formalise talks between the two parties over &quot;a number of issues&quot;.The AIC agreed to form a coalition with the ANC following the August 3 local government elections, which saw the latter losing key metros to the DA.Thanks to the coalition formed between the two parties in Ekurhuleni, the ANC was able to retain the metro.&quot;There are lot of municipalities where we are working together &#8230; but we are meeting to discuss the reinstatement of Matatiele to KwaZulu-Natal,&quot; Kodwa said.&quot;We cannot pre-empt the outcomes. What is important is that we agreed to sit down.&quot;Kodwa said both parties appreciated that it was an issue they needed to discuss as there were communities involved in this matter.
