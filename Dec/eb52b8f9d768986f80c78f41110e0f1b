After posting one of the strongest rallies in emerging markets this year, SA&rsquo;s rand is headed for a 12% drop in 2017, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.But Deutsche Bank says they have got it wrong.The fourth-biggest foreign-exchange trader is disregarding political uncertainty that has slowed the currency&rsquo;s advance in 2016, predicting a gain of about 7% to R12.50/$ next year.Inflation outlookInflation is slowing. The South African Reserve Bank expects the rise in consumer prices averaging 5.8% in 2017, down from a seven-year high of 7% in February. That meant the yield on South African assets would remain attractive, even as US interest rates rose, Deutsche Bank economist Danelee Masia said in a report on December 5.Economy reboundingSA&rsquo;s economy barely avoided a recession in 2016, but things are looking up. Growth should accelerate to 1.4% in 2017, more than the central bank&rsquo;s estimate of 1.2%, as companies rebuilt profit margins through a combination of cost efficiencies, job cuts and wage restraint, said Deutsche Bank. A rebound in agriculture following the worst drought in more than 100 years may also fuel growth.Current-account gapThe rand&rsquo;s Achilles heel, the current-account deficit, is narrowing as subdued demand constrains imports. The shortfall shrank to 3.1% of GDP in the second quarter, from 5.3% the previous three months. Deutsche Bank predicts it will decline to the smallest margin in six years in 2017, making the rand less vulnerable to capital outflows as the US lifts interest rates. Third-quarter current-account data is due on Friday.The rand declined 1.4% on Thursday to R13.66/$. Rand Merchant Bank, the second most-accurate dollar forecaster in the third quarter according to Bloomberg rankings, predicts the currency will strengthen to R13/$ by the end of 2017. The top rand forecaster, Swissquote Bank, expects the currency to be at R14.70/$, while third-placed ABN Amro Bank expects a drop to R15.25/$.Bloomberg
