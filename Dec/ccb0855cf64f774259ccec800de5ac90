Two arms of the state will try and grapple with governance issues at the SABC this week. Environmental groups will make a bid to halt the government&rsquo;s new nuclear build procurement process, while the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) prepares to elect new leaders.The High Court in Cape Town is expected to hand down judgment on Monday in an application brought by the DA to remove SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng from his position at the broadcaster.Motsoeneng and Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the SABC board chairman and last remaining nonexecutive board member, continue to fight to remain at the state broadcaster despite a mounting pile of mostly unfavourable court orders.President Jacob Zuma on Friday issued a statement wishing "to remind public servants and persons serving in state-owned entities that they are all required to respect Parliament and abide by oversight requirements of Parliament at all times, without any exception".The ad hoc committee looking into the SABC crisis has resolved to summon Maguvhe to appear before it.Last week, two former board members and a one-time CEO detailed the rot at the national broadcaster and how Communications Minister Faith Muthambi had pushed for Motsoeneng s appointment.Lobby group Right2Know, which insists that current and former SABC employees are subject to "mafia tactics" from management in a bid to silence them, is expected to make its submission as part of the inquiry on Wednesday.Numsa, SA s biggest union, will on Monday hold its 10th national conference, aiming to develop a "fightback" strategy against high unemployment and continued job losses in the manufacturing sector.Numsa is likely to deliberate on its status after leaving Cosatu. The union remains sceptical about the tripartite alliance.In addition to talking about programmes to fight unemployment, inequality and poverty, Numsa delegates are expected to make decisions on how to proceed in developing a new alternative labour federation, as well as the establishment of a revolutionary workers party.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the High Court in Cape Town will hear a bid to halt the government s new nuclear procurement process.The South African Faith Communities Environment Institute and Earthlife Africa Johannesburg maintain that the government has not followed legal procedure in the procurement process, and has failed to meet the requirements of the Constitution for a fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective process.
