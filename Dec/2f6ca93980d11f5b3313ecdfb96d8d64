The struggling Springboks finally gave South Africans a reason to be cheerful at Newlands on Thursday&sbquo; but not on they rugby field.Instead they had a crowd of 7,110 cheering down the road at the cricket ground&sbquo; where they may have helped Hashim Amla get his groove back.Admittedly&sbquo; the game was the less than serious Nelson Mandela Legacy Cup&sbquo; an annual charity event pitting the Proteas against the Boks over 20 overs.But the way Amla went about drilling his 94 off 43 balls &mdash; eight of them hit for four&sbquo; another five for six &mdash; suggested he could be on his way out of the woods that have stopped him from scoring a century for SA in a dozen completed innings across all formats.Amla&rsquo;s effort helped the Proteas reach 252/9. They limited the Boks&rsquo; reply to 236/9 to register victory by 16 runs.The result was nothing unusual for a Bok team who have lost eight of the 12 Tests they have played this year&sbquo; including one to Italy.Other highlights of Thursday&rsquo;s match were two athletic catches in the deep by winger Sergeal Petersen&sbquo; centre Damian de Allende&rsquo;s 55 off 30&sbquo; Imran Tahir&rsquo;s furiously serious two overs&sbquo; in which he took 2/3&sbquo; and JP Duminy&rsquo;s very occasional wicketkeeping &mdash; replete with two stumpings.Graeme Smith served as the Boks&rsquo; player-coach&sbquo; and during his innings of 13 confirmed that his technique had not lost any of its rough edges even though he retired more than two years ago.Faf du Plessis&sbquo; meanwhile&sbquo; was greeted by a forest of sucker sticks when he came out to bat&sbquo; each of them protruding from the mouth of a Bok fielder.At the time of writing&sbquo; the International Cricket Council had shown no interest in pressing charges despite what appeared to be multiple flagrant transgressions of law 42.3.TMG Sport
