The share price of mining contractor eXtract fell 10% to 36c on Monday morning after it warned it could lose a R500m a year contract in Botswana. The group, which was formerly known as Eqstra, said Botswana diamond miner Boteti intended to terminate its contract at the Karowe operation on December 13. Boteti also said it intended to withhold payment owed to eXtract subsidiary Eqstra Botswana for work done in October and November. "The company categorically denies and refutes any allegations of improper conduct relating to the performance of its contractual obligations," eXtract said in Mondayâ€™s statement. The contract contributed about R8.5m a year in profit, eXtract said. "Eqstra Botswana will seek to recoup its damages, in terms of the contract, which was to endure to December 2020. Discussions are ongoing to minimise job losses in Botswana," the statement said. Boteti Mining was created in January 2014 and owns 100% of the Karowe. Boteti in turn is wholly owned by Lucara Diamond, a Canadian company listed in Toronto and Botswana and on the Nasdaq Stockholm. In terms of the contract dispute Lucara has said it is unaware of any illegal activities in terms of the contract by the parties involved and is still in discussions with Eqstra Botswana with regards to its performance under the contract. Despite this, Lucara has announced that the process of moving to a new mining contractor has began.
