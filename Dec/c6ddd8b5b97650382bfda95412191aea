Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s election camp got its prediction algorithms wrong because of overconfidence and emotion, staff at the University of Johannesburg&rsquo;s Institute for Intelligent Systems believe.This led to the inputting of flawed data that delivered off-target results."This is not to suggest that Donald Trump did everything right, but he benefited significantly from Clinton&rsquo;s missteps," says Prof Bhekisipho Twala, director of the university&rsquo;s artificial intelligence unit."The conclusion is clear: Clinton lost the election through costly mistakes and all Trump had to do was pick up the pieces. Our findings have strong messages that can be applied to SA."Twala believes the Democrats basked in the reflected glory of eight years of the Barack Obama government and paid scant attention to changes in voter attitudes, mind-set, economic standing or general views &mdash; especially among the middle and lower economic classes."Attitudes don&rsquo;t stand still from what polls showed four years ago and what they will be saying today," he says."The result of the 2016 US presidential election underscores the importance of good data quality &mdash; that is, without flaws or bias. Data can be corrupted in many ways, smugness and overconfidence included."If you fill your machine learning programme with data that is flawed, or with a sample that is biased, then the predictions will be wrong as well. That&rsquo;s what happened in the US election," says Twala.The institute has been conducting a postmortem on US presidential polling with an eye on the lessons it might hold for SA&rsquo;s 2019 general election."We&rsquo;re also learning about the vagaries of modern politicking and electioneering in general. It&rsquo;s an interesting learning curve, especially in analysing the mistakes made by both sides," Twala says."The South African election will be upon us before we know it, so it&rsquo;s never too soon to start honing the strategising and predictive skills required."It is important to revisit voter attitudes and patterns every year and ensure that you&rsquo;re tuned in to all levels of the electorate. Be dispassionate."The UK&rsquo;s Brexit referendum also holds valuable lessons on politicking in an age of hi-tech poll dissection, not thought of just a few years ago."Many decisive issues are not clearly flagged; they need careful searching for and these are the vital beacons," Twala says."Our US election autopsy is already delivering some interesting new light. Most importantly, perhaps, on how easy it is to overlook issues that are begging for attention but are ignored because we don&rsquo;t believe they should be there, or they conflict with the wish list."Clinton&rsquo;s defeat was a classic case of "counting the White House chickens before they hatched", he believes."Our post-election artificial intelligence, or rather machine learning workups, are quite specific that this is the case."Machine learning is a relatively new development in the artificial intelligence sphere and is increasingly employed to look into wide-ranging issues by sifting through myriad assumptions and probabilities.While artificial intelligence (AI) has tenuously developed since the mid-1950s, it came into clearer focus about four years ago with the emergence of machine learning, the sector&rsquo;s first real brainchild."Machine learning, at its most basic, uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world," says US-based AI researcher Michael Copeland."So rather than hand-coding software routines with a specific set of instructions to accomplish a particular task, the machine is &lsquo;trained&rsquo; using large amounts of data and algorithms that give it the ability to learn how to perform the task."Machine learning came directly from minds of the early AI crowd, and the algorithmic approaches over the years included decision tree learning, inductive logic programming, clustering, reinforcement learning and Bayesian networks, among others."Digestible InformationTwala believes SA should get to grips with new and potentially better ways of weighing up the probabilities and assumptions that inform the electorate.Properly handled machine learning can present digestible information that will help in understanding what can go wrong."Doing this kind of analysis defines the new UJ [University of Johannesburg] institute. Its post-election research is unapologetic in its view that arrogance lost the day for the Democrats, not to mention the superciliousness that blinkered the warning signs," he says."Trump put his arm around the shoulder of Joe Citizen and promised a leg up the income and job ladder while pledging solutions to worrisome social and economic issues. The Democrats were so convinced that their candidate had the experience and preparedness over Trump that the result was nothing less than a shoo-in."Conceding that his algorithmic version was written with the help of 20/20 hindsight, Twala insists there was an intellectual and social smugness in the Clinton campaign that probably did much to hurt her presidential hopes.His research shows that Trump listened carefully to Clinton&rsquo;s arguments, was able to pick holes in them and exploit them &mdash; especially those that worried the "working class" &mdash; and he proposed ways of dealing with them.Post-election statistics indicate that significant numbers of the female and black vote deserted the Democratic cause. "This is not to say they flocked to Trump; mostly they simply did not turn up," says Twala."States key to Clinton reflected a sharp drop in voter numbers. This is eerily similar to a growing ANC supporter disaffection with President Jacob Zuma and his coteries marking voter patterns in SA. It&rsquo;s one the ANC will have to watch."The ANC should do a mindset audit of voter attitudes, wants and worries. And it s no good waiting for 2019. The time to start tracking voter attitudes is now," he says.FNB chief economist Sizwe Nxedlana says the US s unequal income distribution played&nbsp;a role in the outcome of the election."US economic output has increased sixfold over the past 60 years. Median wages have been stagnant for the past four decades," he says.Twala says that state of affairs could not go on indefinitely. "The well-offs comeuppance was at hand and the fuse was fizzing. Clinton should have thrown them a few more crumbs."SA, take note. We live in a country that is one of the world s most unequal and that makes the millions of voters at the bottom of the income pile ripe for the picking by the populists."Brexit was clearly a bellwether for politics, but most Democrats chose to "follow the sheep rather than watch what the ram was doing"."Even as investment fled or avoided Britain by the billions of pounds, the Democrats in the US paid scant attention."There is a moral to every election story: watch trends in like democracies. Listen to what people are saying with every vote cast. If it seems that there is a shift in voter attitudes it s because there really is."
