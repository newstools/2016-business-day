The rand weakened to over R14/$ on Thursday morning as the dollar strengthened against most currencies following the US central bank’s decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.

All three of Wall Street’s major indices closed down on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.81%.

London’s FTSE 100 closed 0.28% lower ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate vote which will be announced at 2pm South African time. The UK’s central bank is expected to announce no change to its 0.25% rate and £435bn quantitative easing programme. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.69%, but Tokyo’s manufacturers benefited from a weaker yen. The Topix gained 0.57% and the Nikkei 225 0.31%. The JSE’s all share index closed 0.24% lower on Wednesday, dragged down by Steinhoff’s 7.11% drop to R70.58 and Shoprite’s 7.17% drop to R178.97 following a proposal by major shareholders Christo Wiese and the Public Investment Corporation to merge their African retailers. The deal would see Frankfurt- and Johannesburg-listed Steinhoff sell Pep, Ackermans and other South African retailers to Shoprite in exchange for shares, making it a major shareholder in the grocery chain.
