The loose consensus among economic commentators is that SA will not lose its investment grade credit rating with S&amp;P Global Ratings when the announcement is made on Friday night, but that it really is too close to call.The case for a downgrade was strengthened last week when Fitch Ratings changed the outlook on SA&rsquo;s BBB-foreign rating from stable to negative.With S&amp;P having already changed the outlook on SA&rsquo;s BBB-rating to negative, it has no more slack to cut SA before moving the foreign rating into sub-investment (junk) territory.But many leading economists are hopeful that S&amp;P will stay its hand given several positive developments that have occurred since its mid-year review.These include the withdrawal of charges against finance minister Pravin Gordhan, a solid medium-term budget, an amicable three-year wage agreement in the platinum sector; broad agreement on a package of labour stability reforms, and the release of a new energy mix plan which significantly pushes back government&rsquo;s controversial nuclear programme.In addition, the economy is cyclically adjusting, with inflation and interest rates expected to peak this quarter and the current account deficit having narrowed materially.As such, SA might just manage to avoid a downgrade to junk.BNP Paribas Securities economist Jeffrey Schultz pointed out that the release of the public protector&rsquo;s State of Capture report last month served to highlight the degree of political interference and corruption at the state-owned company level.Also negative was the current political leadership uncertainty, government&rsquo;s failure to conclude mineral reforms, and the weak growth outlook, which threatens to keep per capita GDP growth below SA&rsquo;s peers.By S&amp;P s reckoning, SA is already junk-rated in terms of its GDP growth performance and GDP per capita income.Among the few pillars supporting SA s investment grade rating has been the national treasury s adherence to its fiscal consolidation plan and its drive with business and labour to expedite structural reforms to put the country on a faster growth path.In June, S&amp;P listed four structural measures that were needed to place the economy on a firmer footing and allow SA to hold onto its investment-grade rating.The country needed a reliable energy supply; labour market reform to reduce damaging strikes and raise youth employment; clarity on the minerals regime; and a reduction in political infighting and interference in state institutions.After the medium-term budget, Fitch noted that SA s reform efforts so far amounted to little more than "fine-tuning" and would be insufficient to raise business confidence.If S&amp;P takes this view, SA could be in for a nasty surprise on Friday night.Financial markets have priced the odds of a ratings downgrade to junk at abound 50%, down from about 70% earlier this year. So should the worst happen, there is likely to be a negative knee-jerk reaction in the rand and bond markets.Rand weakness, if sustained, would beget higher inflation, higher interest rates and bond yields, raising the cost of investment for both the public and private sectors. Consumers too would have less money to spend. This means growth would be lower.An alternative view that several economists share is that S&amp;P will leave SA s foreign currency rating in tact but lower by one notch SA s local currency rating from the current BBB+, which is three notches above non-investment grade. This would bring it in line with Moody s rating."Such a move would, we believe, serve as a warning signal that S&amp;P is uncomfortable with the direction in which SA s debt-to-GDP ratio is moving and that should structural economic reforms not materialise to boost growth before June next year, a foreign-currency downgrade is inevitable," said Schultz.Citi economist Gina Schoeman is more sanguine. She pointed out that it requires two agencies to downgrade a country to sub-investment grade to trigger a change to investment mandates.This means that if S&amp;P does kick SA s rating into the junk heap, capital outflows may not necessarily follow. Any negative rand reaction would, therefore, be mostly sentiment based and would not necessarily be sustained.
