The government&rsquo;s "look East" plan to help solve mathematical illiteracy was not likely to work, unions operating in the education sector said on Wednesday.Poor maths and science education is at the heart of South Africa&rsquo;s skills problem.The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2015 research shows that local pupils&rsquo; grasp of simple concepts is "weak" and they struggle to apply the knowledge.On Tuesday, the Department of Basic Education proposed turning to Asian curricula, saying pupils in Japan, Singapore and Taiwan had improved significantly in the areas of content and cognitive maths skills.Executive director at the National Professional Teachers Organisation of SA Basil Manuel said the proposal was likely to flop &mdash; as did outcomes-based education, based on an Australian model in the 1990s.Manuel said many of the root problems in SA s education sector remained unsolved."You can bring any model, but if you don t attend to the basics, you are not going to succeed," Manuel said. The department needed to consider that resources and class sizes in SA were different from Asia or anywhere else in the world.Manuel said the majority of SA s maths teachers were not necessarily "qualified maths people. They will be teaching in the didactic of the subject they were trained in."He said there was a huge outcry about content overload in SA. "The danger with content overload is that teachers will teach what they like and skip over the things they don t like, because there is not enough time to cover the syllabus."South African Democratic Teachers Union general secretary Mugwena Maluleke said that the Japanese model, which is based on early childhood development, required disciplined funding. "That is why the Japanese are performing, because they invest their money where they are supposed to."Maluleke said the country must go back to the National Development Plan "and ensure four-year-olds are socialised in terms of readiness for school".Education was based on context and culture, and SA had to develop its own model, Maluleke said."Our circumstances and cultures are different from the other countries. We need to adapt and ensure that our children are taught maths in their mother tongue, develop it to a level where you can access cognitive and scientific thinking," he said.
