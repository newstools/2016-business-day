An inquiry into the governance structure of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) &mdash; now under way &mdash; had become all the more imperative given the recent twists in the relationship between the tax authority and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, the head of the Davis Tax Committee, Judge Dennis Davis, said on Thursday.The judge could not comment on a rumour circulating in social media that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had appointed a commission of inquiry into SARS headed by himself in addition to the work already engaged in.On Wednesday Gordhan accused SARS top management of a lack of accountability and co-operation, which prevented him from determining the veracity of his reply to a parliamentary question.SARS leadership strongly rejected the accusation in a media statement that expressed their "deepest concern and disturbance" at the "aspersions and blemishes on the character and integrity of its leadership".Gordhan made the accusation in a written reply to a parliamentary question by DA finance spokesman David Maynier concerning the existence or otherwise of a specialised investigation unit similar to the now disbanded rogue unit. The minister said he could not determine the veracity of SARS&rsquo;s denial of the existence of such a unit because of the lack of accountability and co-operation of its top management.SARS said the leadership of the tax authority had responded timeously to 29 parliamentary questions since Gordhan took office during December 2015.It had appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on finance and the standing committee on public accounts five times; and had met Gordhan eight times since he took office to discuss issues of mutual interest.Gordhan had never at any point expressed lack of confidence and/or lack of accountability in the leadership of SARS, the agency said.It subsequently emerged in a newspaper report &mdash; later confirmed by SARS &mdash; that it had set up a secret unit to probe corrupt dealings between members of staff and individuals in the tobacco industry.Davis said in an interview on Thursday that the situation between SARS and the minister was "intolerable" and could not carry on. The minister of finance was accountable for expenditure and revenue and had to report to Parliament about this. He therefore needed to have some basis to hold both arms of government accountable to allow him to do so."The events of the past number of weeks clearly have created sufficient public concern that this matter needs to be brought to clarity as soon as possible," the judge said.Davis noted that the committee&rsquo;s inquiry into the operating model and governance structure of SARS had been going on for several months. One of its aims was to determine whether the governance structure of SARS provided that there was sufficient accountability, transparency and integrity at the tax authority, which currently does not have a supervisory board.The inquiry that the Davis Tax Committee has been conducting into the tax administration also includes a study of whether the current operating model is optimal for its dealing with complex tax issues such as base erosion and profit shifting, high net-worth individuals and illicit financial flows and whether there are sufficient risk protocols in place.Davis said the committee had generated a number of reports and needed to look at the institution itself and the operating model that would be responsible for implementing the recommendations that government finally adopted.
