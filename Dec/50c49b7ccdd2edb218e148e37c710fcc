The internet of things (IoT), digitisation of businesses operations, blockchain, cyber security threats, virtual and augmented reality, and transformation to mobile first platforms top the list of 2017 technology trends.The adoption of the IoT is expected to accelerate and serve as a key driver to the growth and development of information and communications technology.The IoT refers to a network of objects or devices &mdash; or "things" &mdash; that have embedded technology to enable them to interact with each other.The IoT market is in its early growth stage, but the take-up is driven by the need for businesses that are digitising operations. Technology businesses expect 50-billion devices connected to the internet by 2020.Frost &amp; Sullivan research analyst Deepti Dhinakaran says fleet management, retail, energy, security and surveillance and manufacturing will see growth in IoT services during 2017.Other areas such as agriculture, mobile health and wildlife conversation will also grow steadily.George Kalebaila, senior research manager for telecommunications at the International Data Corporation (IDC), says most IoT applications have been cellular-based and under the domain of traditional mobile operators."In 2017, we will start seeing several smaller nonmobile operators deploy low-power WAN (LPWAN) IoT networks to provide low-cost IoT applications," he says.Frost &amp; Sullivan also expects the adoption of LPWAN connectivity to grow significantly, driven by the need for speed, range, and higher power efficiencies.With regards to blockchain, Frost &amp; Sullivan says although all SA banks claim to be investigating blockchain technology, it is unlikely that anything will come of this in the near future."Banks have very little motivation to change their operating models unless incentivised to do so by external factors," says Frost &amp; Sullivan research analyst George Etheredge.As the use of smartphones increases, companies are being forced to integrate services.Nirmal Nair, vice-president for products and marketing at Clickatell, says the complexity, of ensuring customers are able to access what they are looking for on their cellphones is far bigger than most companies believe. Organisations should already be moving from designing for mobile first.The adoption of voice services over Wi-Fi networks (VoWiFi) and long-term evolution (VoLTE) is also one of the Frost &amp; Sullivan trends for 2017 as it expects mobile network operators to ramp up their Wi-Fi network roll-out and voice-over 4G networks to fight off threats posed by over the top (OTT) applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook.Voice revenues from mobile network operators are under pressure as OTT providers have enabled consumers to make calls via the internet. While this results in higher data revenues for operators, it puts pressure on their voice revenues.According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, VoWiFi and VoLTE are becoming accepted as the next generation of mobile communications services. The voice quality on the new platforms are better and the connection faster.Globally, leading operators such as Swisscom are launching their own VoLTE and VoWiFi solutions.
