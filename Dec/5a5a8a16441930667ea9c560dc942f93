The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the kingmaker in the Mogale City council, has thrown its weight behind the DA for a second time following mayor Lynn Pannall’s sudden resignation last week. Pannall, who was voted into office in August through a coalition between the DA, IFP and EFF, resigned on Thursday. The DA said she was struggling with ill health. The council will hold an urgent meeting to vote for a new mayor. The DA seems to have the support of all the other coalition partners. The West Rand council has 77 seats divided among the ANC, IFP, DA and EFF. The ANC has 38, the IFP has one while the EFF and DA combined hold 38. IFP Gauteng chairman Bongani Dlamini said: "Our vote is not a secret, we are voting with the DA and the EFF," he said. West Rand ANC spokesman Refentse Mangope said Pannall had not performed well and there was now an opportunity for the council to vote in an ANC mayor. "Services in the municipality collapsed [under her], there were water issues in Kagiso … and Krugersdorp," he said. He said the ANC would try to convince the IFP to vote with it. Gauteng DA leader John Moodey said he was optimistic his party would hold on to Mogale City. EFF Gauteng chairman Musa Novela could not be reached. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said: "I don’t expect political tension … they are still finding their space."
