Faf du Plessis has been shot in this movie before. So he brought a sure-fire media melter to his first press conference as SA&rsquo;s appointed Test captain: Giorgio, his dachshund.Not that Du Plessis needed to win over a media pack who have not, as some Australian reporters tried to do in November, painted him as a too-smooth-talking, ball-tampering fashion victim.Instead, journalists gathered at Newlands on Wednesday to talk to a man who has, in the absence of the official captain, AB de Villiers, led SA to victory in nine of their last 11 Tests and one-day internationals.Factor into the equation the series wins SA earned over New Zealand and Australia &mdash; twice, home and away &mdash; and retaining Du Plessis as captain became a no-brainer.De Villiers himself saw the truth of it on Tuesday, when he gave up the Test captaincy.But he had not really given up his vaunted position, was Du Plessis&rsquo;s opinion."AB is a better cricketer," Du Plessis said. "So I have to make sure I use other things so I can make sure I get guys to buy into what I want them to buy into."AB just has to walk onto the field and it&rsquo;s already happening. For me it&rsquo;s harder work, I suppose," he said.Happily, Du Plessis, who has captained teams all his cricket life, was up for that hard work."I love captaining, whether it&rsquo;s tennis-ball, backyard cricket," he said. "I think it brings the best out of me as a player. It&rsquo;s about making sure I&rsquo;m always there in the battle, and that gets me ready to play cricket."That said, Du Plessis, who until Tuesday was SA s appointed T20 captain only, knew he was not in Kansas anymore."As a Test captain it s almost as if people are taking you seriously for the first time," he said. "T20 is the fun and the X-factor of cricket."Test cricket is for me the most enjoyable time to be a captain because you have to work on plans for a long period of time," Du Plessis said."You have to strategise on how you re going to make sure you re going to get guys out and continue to challenge guys over a long time."To finally have it now, as something that is set in stone, is a huge honour and I ll be taking it very seriously."I ll try and make sure that the stuff that we ve been working on for the past six months to a year, that we don t let those standards drop."If I keep pushing the guys to make sure we hit those standards, we ll be a consistent team" Du Plessis said.They were exactly that in their 5-0 thrashing of Australia in an ODI rubber in October.Du Plessis warned South Africans not to get too used to that level of success."You re not going to win 5-0 every time. We re going to have to get used to losing a few games," he said."But for me it s about making sure that the cricket side of things is almost a bonus. The stuff that happens off the field is where I want to make sure there s a lot of time and effort going in, that it s a happy team and a team that want to get better," Du Plessis said."But if you have one or two bad days at the office, then you make sure you come back strong and make sure of those basics, that off-the-field stuff."It s been proven over the last while. We went from a team that was really inconsistent [last season, when SA lost five of their eight Tests] to, all of a sudden, a team that became consistent."Amid a rising crescendo of yowling and yapping at his feet, Du Plessis said: "What we want to achieve as a team is to be more aggressive. I ll always look to take the aggressive approach. Hopefully that pays off more than it doesn t."TMG Digital
