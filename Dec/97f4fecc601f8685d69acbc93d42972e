New Zealand citizens visiting SA will be required to apply for a visa as of January 16 2017, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Tuesday.The move follows New Zealand&rsquo;s decision in October to end its visa waiver for South African passport holders dating back to 1996.Announcing its decision on October 3, the New Zealand government cited the number of South African visitors who overstayed the three-month period allowed under the visa waiver, as well as the number who had been denied entry due to fraudulent documentation, and those using the waiver to visit family or friends rather than for business or tourism purposes, Gigaba said.The new visa came into effect on November 21.Gigaba said SA&rsquo;s government, like others, applied the principle of reciprocity in international relations, but in a "pragmatic manner" in line with national interests.Visa fees would remain low, while all other decisions on reciprocal visa requirements would be made in the interests of SA&rsquo;s broader national interests, he said."We have further noted in recent times, a number of countries have imposed visa restrictions on South African passport holders."After a careful consideration of this matter, I have directed departmental officials to look closely at the decisions of these countries and advise accordingly whether or not SA should reciprocate also in these matters," said Gigaba.South African passport holders did not pose a threat to countries, due to improved security systems on the passports as well as broader introduction of biometric measures to improve security at points of exit and entry, Gigaba said.
