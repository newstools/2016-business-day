Bengaluru — Gold edged up on Monday, extending its recovery from a 10-and-a-half-month low hit last week, as the US dollar slipped from a 14-year peak against a basket of currencies. Spot gold edged 0.3% higher to $1,137.76/oz by 4.07am GMT. The bullion touched $1,122.35 on Thursday, its weakest since February 2. Gold now appears to have found a base, however, upside will be limited as investors look to other markets for yield, ANZ said in a note. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.2% at 102.720. The dollar hit a 14-year high of 103.56 following the Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate forecasts on Wednesday. Gold was likely to rebound to $1,160-$1,180 levels before the year-end, said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong’s Wing Fung Financial Group. US gold futures gained 0.2% to $1,139.90/oz on Monday. The Fed hiked rates for the first time in a year last week and projected three more increases in 2017, up from the two projected in September. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on Friday the Fed was likely to need to raise interest rates more than three times next year and faced challenges in gradually cooling off the US economy. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. "Medium- to long-term view [for gold] is not optimistic," said To. "I won’t be surprised if gold prices move down to $1,050 to $1,080 by the start of next year." Spot gold could bounce moderately to $1,153/oz as it had found a support at $1,121, said Reuters analyst for commodities technicals Wang Tao. Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), fell 0.63% to 836.99 tonnes on Friday. Holdings are down over 11% since November. "[The fall in ETF holdings] illustrates the view investors are moving away from gold at least for the medium term," To added. Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long position in Comex gold contracts for the fifth consecutive week, taking it to a 10-month low in the week to December 13, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. Silver gained 0.2% to $16.11/oz. Platinum was steady at $926.20 and palladium was down 0.5% to $691.90/oz. Reuters
