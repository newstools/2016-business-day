The Financial Services Board (FSB) has approached the short-term insurance industry to provide a "voluntary industry solution" to make good on the unpaid policyholder claims of liquidated SaXum Insurance."In my experience, it could be two or three years before the liquidation process is completed. We want to help policyholders as quickly as possible," said Jonathan Dixon, deputy executive officer of the FSB&rsquo;s insurance department.SaXum was liquidated in October after a spike in claims and impairments to its assets drove it to insolvency. The FSB is investigating possible irregular business conduct by the insurer and its underwriters.The regulator was still verifying outstanding claims, Dixon said. Previously the FSB has estimated that 3,500 mostly motor claims, amounting to R15m, remain unpaid.The FSB had approached the South African Insurance Association, Dixon said."We are asking them to explore putting together a fund which could be used to pay out policyholders, many of whom are experiencing dire hardship due to having no access to their motor vehicles. The insurers could then be paid back over time as the liquidation is finalised," he said.In a country where only one-third of motorists are insured, decisive action by insurers to resolve these claims would help to rebuild trust in the industry.Dixon said SA was likely to set up an insurance guarantee fund in time, which would cover policyholder claims in the event of an insurer failure.The Treasury, the Reserve Bank and the FSB issued a discussion paper in August 2015 laying out a special resolution framework for financial institutions. While the paper focused on banks, it undertook to do further work on applications for nonbank institutions, such as insurers.Insurance guarantee funds were fairly common in other countries, Dixon said.
