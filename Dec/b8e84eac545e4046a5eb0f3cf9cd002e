Lacking clear direction from international markets, the JSE took its lead from gold and platinum shares on Thursday morning, which lifted the all-share index 0.14% to 50,360.10 in the first half hour of trade. Precious metals were boosted by a weaker dollar. Wall Street ebbed after recent peak, led by technology stocks. The Dow Jones ended 0.56% off as pension funds were said to be rebalancing portfolios at year-end, buying bonds and selling equity futures. The dollar weakened against the yen on falling Treasury yields and disappointing US pending home sales data, pushing the rand to R13.7333/$, its best level in two weeks. Later today the US is due to release initial jobless claims data. In London the FTSE-100 ended 0.54% firmer. In Tokyo, heavyweight Toshiba had a third day of losses, its credit ratings downgraded after it warned of a substantial pending impairment on an acquisition. This pulled the Nikkei-225 1.32% down. Australiaâ€™s ASX 200 closed marginally firmer on strong gold and resources shares, but the Hang Seng was little changed at a negative 0.06%. Brent crude oil was pulled in different directions by dollar weakness on one hand and rising US crude inventories on the other. It was 0.31% higher at $56.22/barrel. Spot gold reflected dollar weakness, lifting 0.71% to $1,149.44/oz. Base metals were mixed, with three-month LME copper and zinc trading higher but tin and aluminium tending lower. London markets were boosted by commodities prices on Wednesday, particularly gold shares. Randgold Resources, which is listed in London, not Johannesburg, but is held by many South Africans, surged almost 5% to 6,119.45p. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Mondi made headway in London trading but adjusting for a stronger rand/sterling rate, showed losses in early Thursday trade on the JSE. Billiton was down 0.28% at R221.98, Anglo was 1.03% lower at R197.50 and Mondi 1.33% lower at R276.01. Sibanye Gold led the gold shares with a 4.28% surge to R24.37. Among industrial and financial shares, Naspers lifted 1.89% to R2,022.49 but Sanlam eased 0.37% to R62.85.
