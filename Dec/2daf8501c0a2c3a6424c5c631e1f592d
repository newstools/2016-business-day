The South African Communist Party (SACP) is set to ignore its ally&rsquo;s call not to discuss the succession issue in the ANC at its three-day central committee meeting that starts on Wednesday.The meeting will discuss Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa&rsquo;s ascent to the presidency &mdash; an indication that the party has turned its back on President Jacob Zuma, who is punting former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for the top job.Another alliance partner, the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu), has already publicly endorsed Ramaphosa, a former union leader, to take over as leader of the ANC.Neither Cosatu nor the SACP vote in ANC elective congresses, but cumulatively they wield a lot of power as many of their members are also ANC members.Both organisations played a key role in orchestrating Zuma&rsquo;s rise to the ANC presidency.The SACP s second deputy general secretary, Solly Mapaila, on Tuesday confirmed the party would discuss the principle of the deputy president becoming the next president of the ANC.This was despite the ANC telling its members and alliance partners not to discuss the 2017 succession.Dlamini-Zuma has strong support from the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Mpumalanga and North West and from the party s women s and youth leagues."Over the past few months we have elevated the issue of a principled posture towards the succession debate in the ANC, or in the movement," Mapaila said.Following the recent tense three-day ANC national executive committee meeting, there were fears of a purge of dissenters, some of them key members of the SACP.A number of national executive committee members, many of them ministers, had supported a call for Zuma to step down as president of the country, but this was defeated.At the weekend, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande reportedly launched a thinly veiled attack on Zuma, saying he was not afraid of losing his ministerial job.Mapaila was adamant that should any member of the NEC be victimised for voicing their opinion in the national executive committee, the party would respond. This would also be discussed at the meeting."We literally have [ANC Free State chairman] Ace Magashule who has literally said these people must be removed, and the ANC Youth League...."It just shows the deeper sense of patronage politics and lack of understanding of how our movement functions because they have just been sucked into this patronage system," he said."It s like the ticket to political appointment and deployment, which is not the case and should not be the case and has never been the case," Mapaila said."It s a wrong practice. So that s our first task and approach when we look at these things."Apart from discussing succession in the ANC, the SACP will also have the possibility of leaving the tripartite alliance and standing alone as a political party on the agenda.This is not the first time the party will be discussing the matter, but the possibility was revived with renewed enthusiasm last year.The SACP is hoping to discuss this matter again and it will be taken further in discussion documents at its own congress to be held in July next year.
