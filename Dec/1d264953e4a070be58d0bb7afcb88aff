President Jacob Zuma’s close friend Atul Gupta, the most prominent of three brothers from the family who have been accused of using their close relations with Zuma to unfairly enrich themselves, has personal wealth valued at R10-billion. The revelation about the 47-year-old Gupta's wealth appears in the Rich List published in full in the latest Business Times. It is compiled by Who Owns Whom. His cracking of the top 10 on the list that includes Shoprite’s Christo Wiese, Glencore’s Ivan Glasenberg and FirstRand’s Laurie Dippenaar makes him South Africa’s top black billionaire. Mining mogul Patrice Motsepe, for years the leading black businessman on the list, is now ranked at 11th, with personal wealth valued at just over R9.5-billion.
