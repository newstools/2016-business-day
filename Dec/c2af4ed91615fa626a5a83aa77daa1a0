The Banking Association of SA (Basa) says it is unaware of any recent developments involving the banks and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) about the distribution of social grants after March 2017.FNB, Absa, Standard Bank and Nedbank have confirmed there have been no discussions with Sassa or the Department of Social Development.Without the banks, which are needed to help develop a new Sassa card and payment platform, Sassa will be obliged to continue using Cash Paymaster Services, a subsidiary of JSE-listed Net1-UEPS, for several months after the deadline at the end of March.In April 2014, the Constitutional Court declared the CPS contract invalid and ordered the tender process be rerun. The declaration was suspended to give Sassa the opportunity to develop an alternative plan.A Basa spokesperson said the only engagement it had had with the department was a workshop in November attended by Basa, Sassa, the Reserve Bank, the Treasury and the Payment Association of SA. At that meeting, Sassa said an engagement would take the form of a request for information about products to help with payment."As far as Basa is aware, this has not yet happened," the banking association said earlier this week.Basa was responding to a statement released on Monday by the department s director-general Zane Dangor that Sassa had requested information in December, asking the banks to suggest what role they could play after March to help take grant distribution in-house.Dangor said Sassa and the department have "some really good models", but they could not be deployed before October or November 2017.Dangor also acknowledged that Sassa would not be ready to distribute grants on April 1 and a payment partner would still be needed. He gave no indication who the partner might be. As no one else has the capability, it is assumed that CPS is the unnamed partner.However, on Wednesday NET1 CEO Serge Belamant said there had been no talks between his company and Sassa or the department about distributing grants after March. "The 11-million Net1-UEPS cards used by CPS to distribute social grants every month will stop working on April 1," he said.That Sassa was 10 months away from its own deadline indicated little had been achieved since October 2015 when it gave the Constitutional Court undertakings it would be ready to take distribution in-house by the end of March. Despite this, Sassa s only engagement with the banks was in November 2016.Basa said wide-ranging comments had been given in response to Sassa s draft plan and all the interested parties expressed willingness to support the process. "However, given that the plan was only in draft form at this late stage, Basa was concerned that the deadline might not be met and an onerous burden would be placed on its members to rescue the process at short notice," it said.David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, said with no obvious plan for April 1, Sassa s incompetence had made it impossible to do anything but roll over the CPS contract for several more months. He said this would be "contemptuous of the Constitutional Court".
