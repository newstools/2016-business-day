In the war against carbon-based energy, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a major role.Not only does it dispose of massive grants to approved climate research scientists, it hosts a bureaucracy that has grown into an empire of about 15,000 people, safe in their jobs, with ironclad pensions, and all entirely salaried with taxpayers&rsquo; money.If any state department can be said to be "captured", the EPA is the one to study. Under successive Democratic Party administrations, it has enjoyed a fireproof status, immune from staff or budget constraints. But now the sky has fallen in.There is going to be a Republican administration and the US president will be Donald Trump, a climate change "denier" if ever there was one.Worse, the president-elect has appointed a new political head of the EPA who is also a denier.As it happens, the new incumbent does not doubt that human activities are adding carbon dioxide to the planet s atmosphere. However, he simply doesn t think it augurs the end of the world, and he certainly believes it does not justify the huge amounts of money greens urge should be spent on making, at best, a minute dent in the planet s overall temperature.What is at stake for the minions in the EPA and those who feed on it is not small change. It is billions of dollars dished out every year in the name of saving the planet.Wind energy machines consume more than $170bn a year in various forms of subsidy such as tax breaks, money grants and for guaranteeing loans to wind energy companies.All this is now potentially at risk, threatening an end to the special status enjoyed for so long by approved climate scientists, if Myron Ebell does take over the EPA. With a Republican majority in the US Congress and Senate, it looks like a slam dunk.But maybe not. The green lobby has already begun to fight back and is putting its considerable propaganda machine into turbo mode. They fear a cutting back of the overstaffed EPA, and the end to the green gravy train, the loss of green jobs and green industry, which altogether soak up about $2.5-trillion.Needless to say, media commentators, including those of the New York Times that got it spectacularly wrong by backing Hillary Clinton to win the presidency, led the charge, calling Ebell a denialist who wrote an alt-science (junk science) memo.As a matter of interest, the style book all New York Times writers are supposed to follow condemns the use of "denier" because the word has the pejorative ring of Holocaust denier. No matter.Green writers including bloggers have written such things as: "We should have war crimes trials for these bastards some sort of climate Nuremberg."Other opinionistas have suggested oil executives be "tried for high crimes against humanity and nature", and one wrote that climate sceptics should be jailed (presumably without trial).Ebell was "bought by ExxonMobil" and other so-called "dark-money donors". He had spent decades working in favour of the fossil fuel industry by trying to undermine climate science. He even once had a job in Washington helping to hurt endangered animals.How effective this barrage of hate will be remains unclear. Democratic senators and Congress people might be able to filibuster to try and delay any anticlimate alarmist legislation, but the US public those outside New York, Boston and California clearly has not bought the green agenda.To judge from the anti-Ebell hysteria, it looks to many that climate change alarmism is less to do with the climate and more about power, the silencing of dissent and accessing public funds.It may be even more.As Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, put it in a rare moment of candour before last year s climate change conference in Paris, France: "We are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution."That explains the attacks on the oil industry, on all heavy industry, and at just about everything that makes modern life comfortable.
