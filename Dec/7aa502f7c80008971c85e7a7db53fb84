The rand was relatively firmer at midday on Tuesday due to dollar weakness ahead of US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to increase interest rate to 0.75% from 0.5%. ETM Analytics market analyst Ricardo da Camara said the market had priced in an interest rate increase, but there was the possibility that the Fed might not go through with it. Da Camara said that an important factor would be the Fed’s outlook on the US economy in terms of inflation and growth in 2017. Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns expects the dollar to be a major risk to the rand in 2017. He said the stimulus measures that Donald Trump favoured could lift growth, increase inflation and ultimately lead to faster rate hikes, which would benefit the dollar. At 11.27am, the rand was at R13.5969 against the dollar from Monday’s R13.6127. It was at R14.4407 to the euro from R14.4815 and R17.2608 to the pound from R17.2544. The euro was at $1.0621 from $1.0637.
