It came down to a touchline conversion kick, but the Blitzboks&rsquo; luck ran out as the ball sailed wide to give England a 19-17 win in a pulsating Cape Town Sevens final.Justin Geduld could not be blamed for missing the difficult kick to Werner Kok&rsquo;s last-gasp try, but it was a match in which SA were seldom on the front foot and they eventually ran out of time and luck.It was a disappointing end to a fantastic weekend of Sevens rugby that has firmly entrenched the Cape Town leg of the HSBC World Series as a "must do" tournament to rival the grand old dame of Sevens tournaments, Hong Kong.A capacity 110,000 fans poured into the iconic Cape Town Stadium over two days and the home team did their bit by making it all the way to the final. In the end they came up short against a better team over 14 minutes of breathless rugby.The final defeat was the Blitzboks&rsquo; first loss of the season in their 12th match after they won in Dubai last week and their first tournament loss in SA for four years.But the 19 points they earned for second place leaves SA on top of the overall standings on 41 points after two rounds.

From then on the visitors controlled the match.England s record try-scorer Dan Norton slipped over in the corner on half-time to give his side a crucial lead going into the break.A wonderful surge by Rosko Specman levelled the scores after Branco du Preez converted early in the second period.
