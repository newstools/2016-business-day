The Young Communist League of SA says it does not support calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down, but has called on him to unite the ANC before his term in office ends.The league&rsquo;s national secretary, Mluleki Dlelanga, said on Sunday Zuma was elected by the ANC, and for that reason it did not support the calls for him to step down.Its parent body, the South African Communist Party (SACP), supports the call for a broad national consultative conference to discuss how to arrest the decline in ANC support.Briefing the media after the league&rsquo;s national council meeting in Soweto, Dlelanga said Zuma had a responsibility to end factionalism and unite the ANC."It is a matter of fact that in the ANC currently, there are two dominating factions &mdash; one that supports [Nkosazana] Dlamini-Zuma and the other that supports [Cyril] Ramaphosa."Therefore, among his [Zuma&rsquo;s] responsibilities is to unite those factions so he can leave an ANC that can respond to the needs of the country."Dlelanga said the league felt strongly that Zuma should no longer allow "his name to be dropped" by people seeking influence and wealth.Atul Gupta, who has a close relationship with Zuma, is the seventh-richest South African, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published yesterday.The 47-year-old replaced Patrice Motsepe as SA&rsquo;s wealthiest black businessman.On Saturday, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande told the young communists he did not care if he was fired from his position as higher education minister for saying that a leader who could be "bought" was not fit to head the ANC.Political analyst and University of SA professor Somadoda Fikeni said Nzimande&rsquo;s comments indicated a rift between the different components of the ruling tripartite alliance, which signals high levels of frustration.The SACP&rsquo;s leadership, he said, particularly those members serving in government, was becoming bolder in voicing its concerns."It looks like the gloves are off in the sense they are willing to bargain with whether they are willing to be part of the alliance or not."The situation in the alliance was a preview of the ANC succession battle that was coming in 2017, Fikeni said.Dlelanga said the Young Communist League supported Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as the next leader of the ANC. The party and the country needed a leader who would unite the alliance and deal with corruption and factionalism, the league&rsquo;s leader added.Trade federation Cosatu has pledged its support for Ramaphosa as the next leader of the ANC on the basis of tradition, which held that the deputy president of the party should be its next president.
