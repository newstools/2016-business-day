Tourists spent R39.3bn in SA in the first few months of 2016, highlighting the strategic importance of the sector.The figure was revealed by Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa, who was chairing the International Co-operation, Trade and Security Cluster briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday. The quarterly progress report provided an update on the programme of action towards achieving the goals of the National Development Plan."The realisation of this kind of revenue sustains the local tourism economy. It also indicates that our country remains a popular destination for tourists inside SA, from the region and globally," she said.SA had enhanced its visibility in international and national trade, tourism platforms and investment promotion, she said.Department of Tourism spokesman Trevor Bloem said SA generated significant revenue from tourists because of its relatively competitive currency."They [the tourists] find the price levels attractive. SA is also a value-for-money destination even when the rand is strong."Tourism contributes about 3% directly to SA&rsquo;s GDP and another 9% indirectly.Molewa said foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country had also improved. "According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, lacklustre growth in the global economy has seen FDI inflows declining 16% in the last year. [But] we have experienced growth of FDI," she said.In terms of regional trade integration, Molewa said SA was elected as the incoming chair of the Southern African Development Community.The cluster&rsquo;s participation in global structures continued and it had been led by ambassador Tebogo Seokolo as the chair of the International Atomic Energy Agency&rsquo;s board of governors."We hope we have served to provide a concise overview of the work done by the cluster for this year," said Molewa.
