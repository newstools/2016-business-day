Eric Tinkler is being flooded with a deluge of demands for interviews about next week&rsquo;s Telkom Knockout final in Polokwane, but the Cape Town City coach is having none of it.He shot down a question about the final after Tuesday&rsquo;s draw with Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium and has told his club&rsquo;s media department he does not want to speak about the SuperSport United game until after Friday&rsquo;s match against Wits."We&rsquo;ve still got the Wits game and then I&rsquo;ll deal with the final after that&sbquo;" said Tinkler after a reporter asked him about City&rsquo;s chances in the final against Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s team."My players must understand we have a very important league game and we want to win it so that we keep up momentum going into the final. We can&rsquo;t afford to be thinking about the Telkom final just yet."After the Wits game, City will return home to begin preparations for the final&sbquo; which takes place next Saturday at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane.Itumeleng Khune is expected to play in Saturday&rsquo;s Absa Premiership clash for Kaizer Chiefs against Chippa United, but centreback Mulomowandau Mathoho will definitely miss the game.The participation of veteran fullback Tsepo Masilela is also unsure and whether he and Khune travel to Port Elizabeth on Friday may only be determined after a morning training session on Friday.TMG Digital
