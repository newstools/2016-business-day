Charles Walters on Monday unexpectedly stepped down as CEO of industrial supplies giant Invicta Holdings barely 18 months after taking the hot seat.Invicta, in which retail tycoon Christo Wiese is the largest shareholder, is one of the largest industrial counters on the JSE with a market capitalisation of more than R7.5bn.No reasons were given for Walters&rsquo; shock decision, but the company said he would remain available in a consulting capacity until the end of November 2017.Former CEO Arnold Goldstone, Invicta&rsquo;s executive deputy chairman, will reassume the role of CEO from February.Goldstone served as Invicta&rsquo;s CEO from April 2000 to April 2015 &mdash; a period of rapid growth for the acquisitive company.Even though most market watchers were taken aback by Walters&rsquo; resignation, the share price was unruffled and trading at a 12-month high in the afternoon. Shares in Invicta &mdash; which are trading under a cautionary notice &mdash; are up about 24% in the past 30 days.Walters earned his stripes as CEO of BMG, one of Invicta&rsquo;s biggest and most profitable divisions. He served nine years at BMG. On his promotion to Invicta deputy CEO, Walters was replaced at BMG by former ARB Holdings executive Byron Nichles in late 2014.The resignation of Walters is the second executive shake-up at Invicta in the past six months.In August, board changes were triggered after the resignation of Nichles, the executive in charge of Invicta s engineering consumables division (which includes BMG), who suffered a heart attack earlier this year. This meant Walters took up the role of executive chairman of Invicta s engineering consumables businesses with Goldstone assuming the role of executive chairman of Invicta s Capital Equipment Group and Building Supplies Group.While the company did not provide details on Walter s resignation, market sources suggested the existing executive structure might not have been practical. One source, who asked not to be named, speculated that "push came to shove" as a result of Invicta s possible new strategic direction that is rumoured to be the subject of the recent cautionary notice."It may be that Walters would have played a different role in future?" the source said.Invicta has hinted strongly at making sizeable acquisitions offshore and has even raised the possibility of a listing on a major offshore bourse.Vunani Securities small-to mid-cap analyst Anthony Clark said the shock of Walters resignation was softened by the re-appointment of the reliable old guard in the form of Goldstone.Clark, though, admitted the reasons for the sudden resignation were a mystery. "Could it be that Walters was just too nice?"
