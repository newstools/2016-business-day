Foreign direct investment into SA has declined steadily this year, but so has outward investment by local companies expanding offshore.SA recorded small inflows of direct investment on a net basis in the past two quarters, representing a turnaround from the sizeable net outflows seen over the past two years as companies stepped up efforts to internationalise their businesses.The shift in the direct investment trend made a small contribution to improving the financial account of SA&rsquo;s balance of payments, which showed a surplus of 3.5% for the third quarter, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, as it continued to attract more volatile portfolio capital inflows, particularly into its bond markets, as well as bank deposits from abroad.The Reserve Bank&rsquo;s latest quarterly bulletin shows that those capital inflows were more than adequate to finance the deficit on the current account of SA&rsquo;s balance of payments, which widened to 4.1% from a revised 2.9% in the third quarter as export performance deteriorated and the trade account swung from surplus to deficit in the third quarter.Economists expect, however, that the current account deficit, which tends to be a driver of the rand exchange rate, will narrow in the fourth quarter as exports pick up, with Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan predicting a current account deficit of 3.9% for full-year 2016, down from 4.3% in 2015.The bulletin, released on Friday, shows direct "real economy" investment into SA declined to R7bn in the third quarter, from R14bn in the same quarter in 2015. But outward direct investment fell to R1.4bn for the quarter, against R38bn a year ago, suggesting a slowdown in the trend that has seen high-profile acquisitions by South African companies in the UK and Europe in the past few years.The year to date has been a net negative on the direct investment front, with SA continuing to rely on the more volatile portfolio inflows of capital into equities and bonds to finance the deficit on the current account on its balance of payments.Third quarter figures also show a big R26.3bn "other" investment inflow, following an "other" outflow in the previous quarter, which Reserve Bank economist Johan van den Heever said reflected items such as trade credit, and long-and short-term loans by the banking sector. "The banking sector is a major driver of flows on the asset and liability side," Van den Heever said.The bulletin shows, however, that domestic fixed investment continued its decline, with fixed investment going below 20% of GDP again for the first time since 2012, with private sector investment and investment by public corporations contracting."The prolonged decline in real capital spending by private business enterprises &mdash; comprising nearly two-thirds of capital investment &mdash; continued in the third quarter of 2016," the bulletin reported, with aggregate real gross fixed capital formation 3.9% lower in the first three quarters of 2016 than in the corresponding period in 2015.
