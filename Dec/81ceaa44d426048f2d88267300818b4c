Faf du Plessis&rsquo; appeal against his ball-tampering conviction has been set for December 19 &mdash; which means he could miss the first Test against Sri Lanka.An International Cricket Council (ICC) release on Tuesday confirmed the date of the appeal hearing and of the name of the presiding judicial commissioner&sbquo; Michael Beloff.An Oxford-educated English barrister&sbquo; Beloff has a prominent track record in sport &mdash; he sits on the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Lawyers for Du Plessis and the ICC&sbquo; who brought the charge against SA&rsquo;s captain after television cameras spotted a mint in his mouth while he was wetting his fingers to shine the ball during the second Test against Australia in Hobart in November&sbquo; will argue their cases in Dubai.Du Plessis will join the proceedings by telephone.His punishment when he was found guilty by match referee Andy Pycroft was a fine and three demerit points.If Du Plessis is docked another point by Beloff, he will be banned for the first Test against the Lankans that starts on December 26 in Port Elizabeth.And that could happen&sbquo; as was made plain in the release: "According to article 8.2.3.3 [of the ICC code of conduct]&sbquo; the judicial commissioner has the power to increase or decrease&sbquo; amend or otherwise substitute a new decision on the appropriateness (or otherwise) of the sanction imposed at first instance&sbquo; provided that any new sanction is within the permitted range of sanctions."Beloff thus has the power to add a demerit point to Du Plessis&rsquo; load.The resultant ban&sbquo; though inconvenient for a South African team who have rediscovered how to win under Du Plessis&rsquo; apparently effortless leadership&sbquo; would defer the looming problem of how to accommodate ABde Villiers.SA&rsquo;s one-day and Test captain missed the series in those formats against Australia because of an elbow injury&sbquo; but he should be good to go against Sri Lanka.TMG Digital
