Mamelodi Sundowns head off on Monday to the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan buoyed by the return of their "CBD" attack and a comfortable win in the premier league on Saturday. Adding to their optimism ahead of the tournament is a new member who could add another dimension to the Leonardo Castro-Khama Billiat-Keagan Dolly combination (CBD), which started for the first time since July in Saturday’s 4-1 win over Free State Stars. Percy Tau, who scored two goals against Stars, could soon see his initial change CBD to CBDT. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said in recent weeks that Tau had now firmly put himself up as a fourth dimension to CBD and he did just that at Loftus on Saturday. And the CBD were on song too. C degrees Celsius for both teams‚ and on a big pitch‚" Mosimane said. "You have to credit the goal that Keagan scored — it was one of the beautiful goals," Mosimane said. Saturday’s frontline of Castro at centre-forward in front of Tau at deep striker‚ with Billiat on the right and Dolly on the left, could give any team problems. That is what Sundowns will need against international superstars if they want to make an impression. TMG Digital
