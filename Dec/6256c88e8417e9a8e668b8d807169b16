Manchester &mdash; Henrikh Mkhitaryan&rsquo;s first premier league goal earned Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s Manchester United a much-needed 1-0 victory over high-flying Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Sunday.The Armenian, who was carried off on a stretcher with 10 minutes remaining after a heavy tackle left him clutching his ankle, blasted home on 29 minutes after Ander Herrera intercepted a sloppy Harry Kane pass in midfield.Herrera fed the ball through and Mkhitaryan, a &pound;25m close-season buy from Borussia Dortmund who was left out in the cold earlier in the campaign, did the rest with a rocket of a shot over keeper Hugo Lloris.The unmarked Victor Wanyama missed a good chance to grab an equaliser for Spurs following a free kick in the 56th minute, his header going inexplicably wide, while Paul Pogba struck the woodwork for United in the 64th.The hosts remained sixth with 24 points, three behind fifth-placed Tottenham, who might otherwise have overtaken Manchester City beaten 4-2 at champions Leicester City on Saturday on goal difference.United remain one of the two current premier league teams that Kane, last season s top marksman, has yet to score against. The victory was United s first at home in the league since September.Earlier a superb Diego Costa strike stretched Chelsea s winning run to nine matches, equalling their streak in 2007 after they overcame an obdurate West Brom side 1-0. Costa s 12th goal of the season sees the Blues maintain their three-point advantage over Arsenal.West Brom made it difficult for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge until Costa seized on the ball 14 minutes from time, brushed off the attention of Gareth McAuley and rifled the ball past Ben Foster into the top far corner.Chelsea manager Antonio Conte celebrated the victory in his trademark emotional manner and afterwards feted his players for their winning nine in a row scoring 23 and conceding just two goals to boot in a "very tough league".The Italian who made his name as a coach at Juventus, for whom he also played with distinction saluted their character. "I m very happy. We faced a tough, physical team. They re difficult to break down and we showed great patience to find the right solution," said the 47-year-old."It wasn t easy but my players showed me great character and motivation to win."We are working very well. When you don t find the goal, it becomes more difficult but we were very good to find in the right moment to do it."In a match involving two struggling teams, Southampton ended a bad week with a much-needed win, beating Middlesbrough 1-0.Record signing Sofiane Boufal secured the three points with a delightful effort from the edge of the area.Reuters, AFP
