The dollar has bounced back amid fairly positive comments about the outlook for the US economy by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. This is not good news for the rand, which was marginally weaker against the greenback at midday on Tuesday.Yellen said on Monday that the US labour market had improved and was almost at its strongest in the past decade.She defended the value of higher education as a protection against the twin pressures of technological change and globalisation, Dow Jones Newswires reported.In a speech to the graduating class of the University of Baltimore, the Fed chief said a college degree would be increasingly important to help workers compete in a labour market that crossed national borders and was constantly inventing ways to replace people with machines, the newswire reported.The rand was, however, slightly firmer against the euro as investors shied away from the European single currency, in the wake of a suspected terrorist attack in Germany and the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.An attack in Berlin on Monday evening has rattled international markets. A truck ploughed into a Christmas market, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others. Media reports indicate that Berlin police believe the truck was deliberately driven into the market.The assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, has also jolted investors. The ambassador was opening a photography exhibition on Monday when a Turkish police officer shot him dead in what is believed to be retribution for Russia&rsquo;s involvement in the Syrian civil war, according to media reports.At 11.29am&sbquo; the rand was at R14.1551 against the dollar from Monday&rsquo;s close at R14.1421. It was at R14.7075 to the euro from R14.7115 and R17.5327 to the pound from R17.5264.The euro was at $1.0391 from $1.0403.&nbsp;
