Sanlam and short-term insurance subsidiary Santam have bought a further 16.6% stake in Morocco&#8217;s Saham Finances for $329m (about R4.5bn).The deal, which was announced by Sanlam on Wednesday, will expand Sanlam Emerging Markets&#8217; and Santam&#8217;s joint shareholding in Saham, which it first bought into in February, to 46.6%.Sanlam would not comment on plans to buy more shares in Saham. However, CEO Ian Kirk said in a statement the two groups together held strong potential to deliver a better performance to shareholders.&quot;Besides offering further minority protection, increasing our shareholding in Saham to 46.6% shows our commitment towards cementing a stronger strategic partnership.&quot;Saham, which mostly writes nonlife insurance, operates in 26 countries across the Middle East and North, West and East Africa. Sanlam&#8217;s existing 30% share has already contributed significantly to its bottom line. In its operational update for the 10 months to October, Sanlam &#8212; without specifying numbers &#8212; said net earned premiums from its general insurance business line rose 130%. With Saham excluded, premiums rose 17%.Saham has a current price:earnings multiple (p:e) of 13.04, according to Bloomberg data. This is forecast to rise to 13.77 in the 2016 financial year, before dropping to 12.97.Adrian Cloete, portfolio manager at PSG Wealth, said the deal was good for Sanlam, as it now had a meaningful stake in Saham. &quot;Saham Finances is great business with good growth prospects,&quot; he said.&quot;Although Sanlam is paying a relative high multiple, Saham&#8217;s future earnings growth should make this a very well-priced acquisition in the medium term.&quot;It is totally fine to pay a higher p:e multiple for a great business with good long-term growth prospects [because] the p:e multiple unwinds as the earnings growth comes through,&quot; Cloete said.
