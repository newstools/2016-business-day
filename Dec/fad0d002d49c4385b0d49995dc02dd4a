Former Checkers CEO and retail industry consultant Clive Weil died this weekend suddenly after complications following surgery. He was in his early 70s. His funeral took place on Sunday morning."When Weil assumed the TV persona of supermarket chain Checkers in the 1980s it was a marketing masterstroke. But it put a plague on his privacy," the Financial Times wrote in a profile in 2007."Trolley for trolley you don&rsquo;t pay more," was the crafty catch-line from a chubby, bespectacled Weil, happily wheeling a shopping cart along the grocery aisles."The ad worked. It helped rescue a company that had chewed up five MDs in eight years and was teetering on the edge of insolvency. But Weil&rsquo;s bulky appearance and slight lisp made the twolley-for-twolley man a subject of derision and brought him unwanted attention," the article said."It was an unbelievable intrusion, he recalls. I couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere without somebody offering their opinion," Weil told the Financial Times.A graduate of Selborne College and the University of Natal, he had an economics degree and honours in economic development planning. He started work with the department of planning in Pretoria in 1969 for five months."He could not stand the estrangement: being the only English-speaker, and a Jew, in a coterie of tunnel-minded Afrikaners, and repelled by the stultifying futility of apartheid planning," the Financial Times said.He joined Tiger Oats in Durban. His first break came in 1976 when Tiger sent him to Randfontein as CEO of the ailing SA Oil Mills. It had to be rebuilt, he recalls."That&rsquo;s where I learnt that if you give people responsibility, it helps to build them. Of his current clients, he won&rsquo;t say much, except that his time is completely occupied. I specialise in turnarounds," he told the Financial Times.
