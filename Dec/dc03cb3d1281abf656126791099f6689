Bad spending habits by the country&rsquo;s municipalities were undermining their financial stability and service delivery prospects, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Wednesday.Gordhan, who has served as minister of co-operative governance and traditional affairs, said the operating expenditure of the country&rsquo;s 257 municipalities was expected to increase by 30.7% compared to the operating revenue of 19.7%.He said increasing operating expenditure that exceeded revenue was unsustainable.Estimates for the 2015-16 adopted budget for operating expenditure stood at R306bn, while operating revenue in the same period was at R304bn.In an accompanying report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, the Treasury warned that while municipalities intended to raise external loans of R35.4bn to fund infrastructure development in the medium-term review and expenditure period, they were unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover operational expenses for 2016-17.Municipalities have committed to contributing R44bn to infrastructure development.However, the Treasury expects total expenditure to outstrip revenue for each of the respective years of the 2016-2017 medium-term review and expenditure framework.Total municipal revenue was estimated to be R365bn in 2016-17 and increase to R388bn&nbsp;in 2017-18.However, total expenditure was expected to grow from R394bn in 2016-17 to R414bn&nbsp;in 2017-18.In the letter to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete, Gordhan said overspending of the operational budget posed a financial risk to the sustainability of municipalities and would be regarded as unauthorised expenditure."Underspending of the capital budget is indicative of failure by municipalities to construct municipal infrastructure necessary for the provision of basic services to communities," Gordhan wrote."Undercollection of billed operational revenue poses a serious risk to financial viability of municipalities."The Treasury s report into the local government-adopted operating and capital budgets for the 2016-17 medium-term revenue and expenditure framework showed capital budgets growing 66.8% in 2016-17, significantly more than the 25.6% growth in 2015-16.However, a lack of planning and unrealistic surplus estimations would undermine the plans municipalities might have to develop capital-funded infrastructure, it warned."Given the persistent trends in underspending of capital budgets, capital projects will have to be properly and effectively managed to ensure implementation as planned," the report said."The 94.8% increase in internal contributions for the funding of the capital budget indicates the municipalities are unrealistic in the estimation of operation surpluses to fund their capital [programmes]," the report said.Municipalities 2017-18 R1.1bn operational deficit is set to dip to R541.5m and become a R2.2m surplus in 2018-19.
