Parliament&rsquo;s trade and industry committee will next year start drafting National Credit Act amendments to deal with consumer overindebtedness.Proposals adopted by the committee on Tuesday include criminalisation of contraventions of the act.Other amendments would include introducing simpler and stricter enforcement of the act; legal certainly on applying the in duplum rule which limits how much interest can build up; an effective debt counselling framework for low-income workers; and capped debt relief to promote a change in borrowing and spending habits.The report the committee adopted on Tuesday was based on proposals by a subcommittee which looked at submissions by banks, retailers, unions and debt counsellors on the need for debt-relief measures.Credit providers all said legislative debt-relief rules would be too prescriptive and they should be allowed to design customised solutions for clients.The committee reported that the proposals would bring relief to overindebted people and limit widespread abuse of consumers by unscrupulous lenders.At end of June, 9.67-million of the 24-million credit-active consumers had impaired records. Of these, 5.32-million were three or more payments in arrears, 2.58-million had adverse listings and 1.76-million had judgments or administrative orders against them.The committee plans further talks with stakeholders and a socioeconomic impact assessment. While it says debt relief will affect access to credit and cost of credit it will in the long run benefit the economy."The Department of Trade and Industry is also considering various debt-forgiveness measures, but the committee is of the view that overindebtedness must urgently be addressed, and that it is vital that a targeted intervention not be delayed," the committee decided.
