Malelane — Five birdies on the back nine from home favourite Charl Schwartzel catapulted the South African into a share of the lead after the first round of the European Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Championship on Thursday. Defending champion Schwartzel, aiming for a fifth Dunhill title, is tied with Irishman Paul Dunne at six under par at the Leopard Creek Country Club on the border of the Kruger National Park, with six players a shot back. In that group on 67 is Brandon Stone, South African Open champion and Sunshine Tour Order of Merit leader, alongside compatriot Jean Hugo, England’s Max Orrin, Scotland’s Scott Jamieson and Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal. Branden Grace, SA’s highest-ranked player at No16 in the world, is with a group on 68. If Schwartzel, 32, can keep going and win on Sunday he will become only the fourth player to win the same European Tour event five times, joining Bernard Langer, Tom Watson and Tiger Woods in an exclusive club. He failed to fire on his front nine and turned at one under par, but found his touch on the greens heading back to the clubhouse and added five birdies. "I was one under through nine, and was looking at two or three birdies on the back nine, but I ended up making five. I was making good swings and executing well. "It’s too early to think about winning though. If you try and force things in this game it’ll bite you so, yes, just more good swings and executing well for the rest of the week and we’ll see what happens," said Schwartzel. Dunne, 24, is seeking a first European Tour win and his card included eight birdies, but was spoiled by a double bogey on the par-four ninth. "I had a decent first year on the European Tour this year but a few days ago I changed my set-up slightly — pushing the ball a little forward in my stance, and I’m hitting the ball really well now," said Dunne. European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke carded a disappointing 78. Reuters
