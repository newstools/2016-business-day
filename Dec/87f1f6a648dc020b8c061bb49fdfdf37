The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) has refused to provide the Gupta-owned Oakbay companies with access to the 72 records of suspicious transactions reported to it, which are believed to have prompted the closure of Oakbay&rsquo;s accounts by all four major banks in the first six months of this year.In an affidavit lodged in the High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday, FIC director Murray Michell states that Oakbay is not entitled to the records, firstly because the law prohibits it and secondly because Oakbay has not established a legal basis to obtain the records.The FIC affidavit is in response to a court application launched by Oakbay earlier in December to compel the release of the records. However, as this case is related to the application by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for a declaratory order that the finance minister is not entitled to intervene in the business of banks with their clients, the two cases will now be heard together.This follows a directive from Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba last week that the two matters be joined.The FIC states in its affidavit that it will abide by the ruling of the court in the Gordhan matter and does not intend to file an answering affidavit.With regard to the Oakbay application, Michell argues that the Financial Intelligence Centre Act prohibits the disclosure of suspicious transaction records. These records are never released, his affidavit says, not even to law enforcement agencies, which are presented with reports based on the records.The records contain information such as identity numbers, account numbers, signatories and balances which are "nonpublic" and are protected by the Protection of Private Information Act.Michell also argues that as Oakbay has not opposed Gordhan&rsquo;s application for a declaratory order it has not established a legal basis to gain access to the records.
