Winning away in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) is tough wherever you are travelling to&sbquo; but off-form Wits can point to a happy hunting ground on their visits to Lamontville Golden Arrows in recent times.Wits are among the favourites for the PSL title this season but have taken just a single point from their last three games after defeats to Cape Town City and SuperSport United and a draw with Highlands Park.Next up for Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s side is a trip to Golden Arrows on Wednesday&sbquo; a team against whom they have enjoyed fantastic success in Durban over the last decade. Wits&rsquo; last eight visits to Arrows have yielded five wins&sbquo; three draws and no defeats&sbquo; dating back to 2008.Arrows last beat Wits in Durban nine years ago&sbquo; making this away day a favourite for the Johannesburg side.Hunt is wary of his team&rsquo;s slump in form, though&sbquo; but says the results do not fully reflect&nbsp;the performances."We have let ourselves down in the last three games. It&rsquo;s been poor from a results perspective but football sometimes goes like that&sbquo;" Hunt told reporters."You&rsquo;ve got to be brave and stand up. But I will always be honest when we deserve to lose, but that game against Cape Town City [2-3] &ndash; not a chance&sbquo; not the slightest of chance."Highlands Park [2-2] was the same&sbquo; possibly SuperSport [0-2]. Certainly they didn&rsquo;t deserve to beat us.&hellip; "After Arrows&sbquo; Wits&rsquo; final two games of the year are at home to Free State Stars and away at Maritzburg United&sbquo; two games they will certainly expect to win if they are to mount a serious title challenge this year.Meanwhile, Ajax Cape Town coach Stanley Menzo believes Wednesday&rsquo;s clash with Highlands Park could be crucial in shaping the remainder of the season for the Urban Warriors.Ajax have won three games in a row&sbquo; including a 2-0 success over champions Mamelodi Sundowns&sbquo; to lift themselves off the foot of the table.Victory at Highlands Park would continue their rise towards the top eight and be a major boost ahead of the festive season break. But defeat will see them sucked right back into the relegation mix.TMG Digital
