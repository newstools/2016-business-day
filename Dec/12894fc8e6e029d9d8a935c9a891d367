Cricketers will have to continue keeping their mints under their tongues to avoid punishment for transgressing the game’s ball-tampering regulations. That is the upshot of a decision by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) world cricket committee to recommend not changing the laws on the illegal but widespread practice of using artificial aids — sugar is a prime suspect — to help the ball retain its shine. "The world cricket committee believes that no changes should be made to law 42.3(a): the match ball — changing its condition‚" the MCC said. The MCC, the custodian of cricket’s laws, is due to present a revised version of the laws in time for implementation on October 1 next year. The ball-tampering issue hit the headlines in Australia last month when South African captain Faf du Plessis made the mistake of allowing television cameras to capture a mint in his mouth as he wet his fingers to work on the ball. He was found guilty‚ fined and docked three demerit points. But there was lots of support for Du Plessis‚ including from Australian captain Steve Smith, who said: "We, along with every other team around the world, shine the ball the same way." That didn’t cut much ice with the MCC, which said: "The recent incident involving Faf du Plessis brought this law into focus, but MCC’s position — supported by the world cricket committee — is that the law is clear‚ and to try to be too prescriptive by listing banned substances would be counterproductive‚ as something will be missed in the process of such drafting."
