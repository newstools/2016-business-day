London &mdash; The uncapped Test pair of opening batsman Keaton Jennings and all-rounder Liam Dawson will join England for the remainder of their tour of India, selectors announced on Wednesday.South African-born Jennings &mdash; whose father Ray coached the South African national team &mdash; will replace Haseeb Hameed, who has a broken left little finger, and Dawson fills in for fellow left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari, who is struggling with a back problem, the England and Wales Cricket Board said.Hameed is returning home for an operation on the back of plaudits for his half-century in the second innings of the third Test in Mohali on Tuesday, which England lost to go 2-0 down in the five-match series.Durham star Jennings is set to be captain Alastair Cook&rsquo;s 11th opening partner since former skipper Andrew Strauss called it a day four years ago.Jennings, 24, should get an immediate run-out for England Lions against the United Arab Emirates on Thursday before heading to India for the fourth Test in Mumbai next week.Ansari is also due to return to England and Dawson is expected to arrive in India next week from Bangladesh, where he is playing in the Premier League for Rangpur Riders.AFP
