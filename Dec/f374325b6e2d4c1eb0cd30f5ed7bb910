Fewer of life insurer MMI’s clients died in the first quarter of its 2017 financial year than in the year-earlier period, it said in an operational update on Friday morning. The group splits itself into four divisions: Momentum retail; Metropolitan retail; corporate and public sector; and international. All four divisions reported growth in recurring premiums but drops in single premiums, with its international division’s single premiums diving 73% while its recurring premiums grew 21%. MMI said its Momentum retail division’s earnings for the September quarter ran ahead of the matching period in 2015. "Note that Momentum retail had poor mortality experience in the first quarter of the 2016 financial year whereas this quarter’s mortality experience was in line with longer-term norms," the company said in its statement. Momentum retail’s short-term insurance loss ratio for the September quarter was 78%, which is an improvement on its more than 80% loss ratio in the year-earlier period. Recurring premiums in its corporate and public sector division grew 24% while single premiums were down 44% from the September quarter in 2015. "Group risk market pricing remains competitive and this is leading to low conversion rates for recurring premium new business," the company said. MMI said its business in Kenya continued to show underwriting losses on non-life insurance lines. "We continue to take various actions in Kenya to reduce losses in that business as a matter of urgency," the operating update said.
