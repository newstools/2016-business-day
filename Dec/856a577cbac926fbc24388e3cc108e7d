Beleaguered SABC board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe remained defiant on Tuesday, saying he would not step down from his position until he received a formal letter from President Jacob Zuma relieving him of his duties.SABC board members are selected by Parliament and appointed by the president.Maguvhe defended his and Hlaudi Motsoeneng&rsquo;s record at the public broadcaster. Asked by an MP what mark he would give himself for his performance at the SABC, Maguvhe said "8/10".He appeared before a parliamentary inquiry into the crisis at the SABC on Tuesday after being slapped with a summons.Maguvhe, the last remaining nonexecutive board member, and 17 SABC staff, including acting CEO James Aguma and Motsoeneng, walked out of Parliament last week.Maguvhe refused to take part in the inquiry, saying it was "poisoned". The chairman, who is partially blind, also accused the committee of discrimination, saying its members refused to provide documents in Braille.It was not his intention "to be the last man standing". He said: "I am standing because I believe that I was using all my abilities and knowledge to steer SABC in the right direction."Also, I did not appoint myself &hellip; if the appointing authority tells me to go I will go."Maguvhe said several board members had supported the appointment of Motsoeneng in 2014 as permanent chief operating officer because they were not aware the public protector&rsquo;s recommendations were binding. Maguvhe was the deputy board chairman at the time.Motsoeneng was appointed despite a damning report by the public protector that found he had fabricated a matric qualification, purged those he disagreed with and irregularly increased his salary from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year.The recruitment process, including interviews, was not complied with and the position was never advertised.Maguvhe said he voted for Motsoeneng&rsquo;s appointment, although he was not absolutely sure of the status of the protector&rsquo;s findings. "Most of us were not aware that her [the public protector&rsquo;s] recommendations are binding. It was only after the Constitutional Court ruling [on the Nkandla matter]."He said former board chairwoman Zandile Tshabalala had told board members that Motsoeneng was doing a "sterling job". "We are convinced [of his] leadership qualities &hellip; unless I can be proven otherwise &hellip; from where I am, he [Motsoeneng] does get things right," Maguvhe said.He also claimed "almost the entire board" had subsequently agreed to take the public protector&rsquo;s report on review.Ad hoc committee member Makhosi Khoza asked Maguvhe whether there was something wrong at the SABC."I do think there is something wrong with SABC," Maguvhe said. "I don t think most of the people who are there are loyal to the SABC."You discuss things and one minute later you get calls to verify leaks I have joked that if I had the power I would chase everyone and employ new people everyone does as they please there," Maguvhe said.Committee chairman Vincent Smith said the SABC team was "sabotaging" Maguvhe as they had not made it clear to him that his decision to approach the courts to challenge the inquiry was in his personal capacity and he would carry all the legal costs. Maguvhe s application to halt the inquiry was dismissed by the High Court in Cape Town earlier in December. He is appealing against the ruling.MPs across the political spectrum were unimpressed by most of Maguvhe s responses, saying it was clear that he did not understand the principle of corporate governance.Maguvhe, who acted as chairman after the resignation in disgrace of his predecessor, Tshabalala, was appointed permanent chairman in June 2015.He has had an extensive career as an academic, starting as a teacher in Limpopo. He is an associate professor of inclusive education at Unisa and holds a PhD in education for the visually impaired. In 1986, he co-founded the South African National Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted and has worked at the South African National Council for the Blind.The inquiry continues on Wednesday, when Communications Minister Faith Muthambi is due to testify.
