Friday will be a nail biting day for the JSE as traders wait for S&P Global Ratings’s verdict on SA’s sovereign credit rating. Of the big international credit ratings agencies, S&P has the most pessimistic view of SA, rating it BBB- with negative outlook. A one notch downgrade to BB+ would give South African government bonds "junk status". A drop into junk could possibly force government to hastily redeem bonds bought by pension funds on condition they remained "investment grade" — a fate that happened to cement maker PPC after S&P cut its rating to junk. It would also make future government borrowing more expensive as higher interest rates would have to be offered to attract money from a smaller pool of investors. SA-domiciled corporations would suffer as the country’s sovereign rating is used as the ceiling for their credit ratings. Last Friday, SA got a reprieve from Fitch which lowered its outlook to negative while maintaining its BBB- sovereign credit rating, and Moody’s which issued a report on SA without affirming or changing its two notches above junk rating. A bad omen for SA’s sovereign credit rating verdict from S&P was its decision last Friday to cut Eskom’s rating to BB from BB+, placing the power utility’s bonds deeper into junk territory. Judging from stock exchanges trading ahead of the JSE, Thursday’s slide which saw the all share index lose 0.56% is likely to continue. A stumble in this week’s oil rally saw BHP Billiton fall 2.83% to A$24.89 in Sydney, contributing to a Australian Security Exchange’s 0.94% fall in its benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was down 1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 1.16% ahead of the JSE’s opening.
