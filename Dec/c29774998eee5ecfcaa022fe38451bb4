Auditor-general Kimi Makwetu and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba have locked horns over performance targets in the department&rsquo;s 2015-16 annual report.Makwetu has taken issue with the Department of Home Affairs&rsquo; performance targets and its classification of revenue streams. Gigaba&rsquo;s department has finally tabled its annual report, delayed by a wrangle between the department and the office of the auditor-general.The audit opinion about the department has improved from a disclaimer in 2014-15 to a qualified audit opinion in 2015-2016. Home affairs incurred R16m in irregular expenditure in 2015-16, which Makwetu blamed on contraventions of key legislation, and goods and services procured outside of prescribed government processes.Naveen Mooloo, an official from the office of the auditor-general, told the portfolio committee on home affairs on Tuesday that, for 20% of the department&rsquo;s immigration affairs programme, the reported achievements against planned targets were unreliable."We were unable to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence for the target in the one instance," Mooloo said. "In addition, the reported achievements against the planned targets for another important indicator were not reliable when compared to the source information or evidence provided."While the Government Printing Works met targets for its programmes, 14% of the Independent Electoral Commission&rsquo;s indicators were invalid, inaccurate or incomplete. The two bodies fall under home affairs.Gigaba said he was frustrated that the auditor-general&rsquo;s office still considered the department&rsquo;s performance target indicators inadequate as it had discussed this and other matters at length."It presents an unfortunate scenario that makes it look like we are not working with them," Gigaba said.
