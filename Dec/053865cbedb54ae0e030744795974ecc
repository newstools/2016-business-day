The markets had priced in a favourable decision from S&amp;P Global Ratings before markets closed on Friday with the rand strengthening against major currencies.Analysts said the markets had expected the favourable outcome, based mainly on the favourable ratings from Moody&#8217;s and Fitch earlier.The rand gained 36c to breach the psychological R14 barrier against the dollar, closing at R13.80 just ahead of S&amp;P&#8217;s evening release of its review of SA&#8217;s sovereign rating.Against the euro, the rand strengthened by 33c, closing at R14.72. It was 19c stronger against the pound at R17.57.Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond fell slightly to 9.03%, indicating a reduction in government&#8217;s interest expenses.Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio manager at Ashburton Investments, said the S&amp;P decision had been expected by the markets, especially after the other two major agencies &#8211; Moody&#8217;s and Fitch &#8211; kept their ratings unchanged. &quot;The rand and bond markets expected this but the news is still good and we could expect small gains,&quot; he said. &quot;Bonds specifically have done quite well considering how much US and other bond yields have risen globally.&quot;Yields on the 10-year US Treasury note have risen 16.05% in the past six months, while German bunds more than doubled over the same period.Petri Redelinghuys, head of trading at Inkunzi Wealth, said the rating was largely not a surprise to market participants.&quot;I noticed that the equity market had gone very flat and sideways in the later part of the day, although a short while before we closed it rallied rather sharply into the close. I would imagine that this was on the back of the expectation that we would not be downgraded.&quot;
