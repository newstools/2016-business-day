Gauteng Premier David Makhura is preparing for the possibility of the ANC losing the province in 2019.Makhura on Thursday warned about the dangers of wanting to remain in government at all costs."If we are preoccupied with remaining in government we can do wrong things."He said if the ANC-run provincial government continued to do good work it would not matter whether the party was re-elected."Whether we get elected in 2019, at least we can say we did a good job."I don&rsquo;t mind sitting in the opposition benches. We would have left something for the people of Gauteng."The ANC lost two of Gauteng&rsquo;s metros, Johannesburg and Tshwane, to the DA in this year&rsquo;s local government elections.It was a bruising election for the governing party, whose electoral support dropped by eight percentage points. It also lost Nelson Mandela Bay metro in the Eastern Cape to the DA.The DA now has its sights set on Gauteng and is hoping to bring the ANC below 50% in 2019.The drop in the ANC s support has been attributed to the scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma. But the party s leadership decided to take collective responsibility for the decline.Shortly before the elections, the ANC in Gauteng had called on Zuma to do the right thing and step down.Similar calls by Gauteng have been made since the elections by some ANC veterans, alliance partners and national executive committee members.Makhura admitted losing Johannesburg and Tshwane was painful for the ANC but said the party had to move beyond that.But he also could not defend things that were wrong. "I believe in the politics of honour," he said."We can t defend ourselves on things that we are not doing right."Makhura said the ANC in Gauteng would fight tooth and nail to retain the province in 2019, but the party could not try stay in power at all costs
