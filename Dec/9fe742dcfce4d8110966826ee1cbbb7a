Equity market uncertainty and declining inflation have improved the outlook for domestic bonds, which look attractive going into 2017, says Eben Mar&eacute;, head of fixed income at Absa Asset Management.An 8.9% yield on the 10-year government bond (the R186) was relatively high and offered attractive real returns.However, Mar&eacute; said, debt markets were still exposed to the risk of a possible sovereign credit downgrade to junk status, although given the more positive outlook for global growth and commodity prices, SA could escape this outcome.David Knee, chief investment officer at Prudential Investment Managers, said: "South African bonds are cheap compared with their long-term fair value and offer good prospective returns."Bonds had rallied in 2016, but returns were volatile, in part because of swings in the rand, said James Turp, portfolio manager for fixed income at Absa Asset Management."Bonds have been the best-performing local asset class with a 15% year-to-date return. The looming threat of downgrades &mdash; thankfully postponed for now &mdash; probably dissuaded a lot of managers from investing in bonds," said Izak Odendaal, investment strategist at Old Mutual Multi-Managers.The JSE all share index, on the other hand, has been flat, while the Top40 is down on a year-to-date basis."The easing of inflation and diminished likelihood of further interest rate hikes have improved, to an extent, the outlook for interest rate-sensitive assets like bonds and listed property, despite very slow economic growth," Knee said.While additional interest rate hikes might not be on the cards domestically, given SA&rsquo;s reliance on foreign capital flows to fund its budget and current account deficits &mdash; coupled with the fact that the US Federal Reserve was likely to begin raising interest rates in that country &mdash; it was unlikely the Reserve Bank would cut the benchmark repo rate in 2017, Turp said.On developed markets government bonds, Knee said these were expensive and low-yielding compared with their long-term histories."We prefer to hold both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, which have offered solid returns so far this year. At the same time, we are underweight longer-dated bonds and are also holding more cash to protect against the risk of interest rate hikes."In recent months, markets had shifted forward by two years the timing of the first interest rate hike by the European Central Bank, said Jonathan Stubbs, Citi&rsquo;s head of equity strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.While this interest rate hike had been expected only in 2019, the move reflected higher inflation expectations in that region, he said.The new US administration was viewed as being "dollar positive". This would weaken the euro relative to the greenback and would help lift inflation, Stubbs said.Knee said: "Investors should expect more volatility in financial markets in 2017, given the new uncertainties introduced by Brexit and Donald Trump as US president-elect, as well as expectations of a more aggressive interest rate hiking path for the US economy."Slow growth in most major economies, as well as in SA, would continue to weigh on sentiment, Knee said."With many asset values elevated compared with their long-term histories, it will be difficult for returns to measure up to their longer-term performance."
