The 2017 intake at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) allows for 6‚200 first year students‚ and the successful candidates will hear if they are accepted after their Matric results are announced. The university is looking forward to next year’s academic year after concluding its examinations for 2016‚ despite being at the forefront of the Fees Must Fall protests. Supplementary and deferred examinations will be written in December and January‚ depending on the faculty. "We have received almost 70‚000 applications for 6‚200 first year places‚ and all applications have already been processed. Firm offers will be made once matriculation results are announced. We continue to process postgraduate applications‚" said Prof Adam Habib‚ the vice-chancellor and principal of Wits, said on Thursday. Habib said this season’s graduation ceremonies at Wits would run from December 6-13. "Despite the disruptions experienced in September and October‚ through extending the academic calendar and revising examination dates‚ we effectively lost only three teaching days. We are pleased that the 2016 academic year has been concluded successfully." Habib added that he was hopeful a solution would be found in the coming weeks to the underfunding of the higher education sector and what essentially amounted to a national political problem that could be solved only at that level. "The successful completion of the academic year under strenuous circumstances was no easy feat and would not have been possible were it not for the unwavering commitment of the university community including its students‚ staff‚ parents‚ alumni‚ donors and others who supported the university during this time‚" he said. "We thank each and every person who contributes to making Wits great." TMG Digital
