"Inflation as well as pace of interest rate hike expectations among the investors are increasing along with the opportunity cost of holding gold."That&rsquo;s why gold is coming under selling pressure," To said."The trading range is moving lower and it is still going to move down further south to $1,148."Strong US data on Wednesday pointed to economic strength that could further cement the case for an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December.

The Fed next meets on December 14-15 and traders see about a 90% chance that policy makers will raise rates then.
