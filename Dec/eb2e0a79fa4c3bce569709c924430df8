Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen have the poorest parliamentary attendance record of all Cabinet ministers, according to data compiled by the parliamentary information service.Opposition MPs have long bemoaned the erosion of Parliament&rsquo;s oversight function, citing its presiding officers&rsquo; lax attitude in ensuring that Cabinet ministers attend sessions in the National Assembly and appear before committees.The ANC parliamentary caucus suffered embarrassment recently after it failed to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill on two occasions because of truant MPs, with chief whip Jackson Mthembu vowing a crackdown.Several disciplinary hearings against ANC MPs are pending because of their failure to attend parliamentary engagements.Records from the People&rsquo;s Assembly service show Mineral Resources Minister Zwane was registered absent for 31 committee meetings and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Van Rooyen was absent for six meetings without either offering apologies.Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini each missed four meetings.However, they had offered apologies for their absence.Mthembu said ministers, deputy ministers and ANC MPs would be held to strict standards when it came to fulfilling parliamentary duties.ANC MP Mathole Motshekga, the head of the party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee in Parliament, on Thursday said the year-end rush to conclude the business of the legislature meant the governing party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee would be unable to wrap up proceedings against errant MPs.These now would be dealt with in early 2017.However, when it came to the absenteeism of Cabinet ministers, Motshekga said: "This matter is being waged as a political campaign by the opposition."It is easy to establish when members of the executive need to be absent. We have records to establish reasons for absence and whether they had permission to be absent."DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said one of the frustrations of working in Parliament over the past year was contending with ministers, such as Zwane, who provided unsatisfactory answers to questions and read out a prepared answer multiple times in one sitting.Parliament was also found wanting by the Constitutional Court for its mishandling of the Nkandla matter, especially in dealing with the public protector s remedial action contained in the Secure in Comfort report.At its recent caucus lekgotla, the ANC in Parliament called on members to do introspection on how it happened that party members had come to defend the indefensible.National Council of Provinces chairwoman Thandi Modise said presiding officers applied rules consistently and only came under scrutiny when dealing with the opposition."Our job is to protect the programme of Parliament, full stop."The perception that we call party members to order only when they are from opposition parties is not correct," she said.She said maintaining discipline among MPs and ensuring they attended house sittings was the job of party whips.
