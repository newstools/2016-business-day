The DA has made a Promotion of Access to Information Act (Paia) application to the Presidency, asking for documents underpinning President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s decision to refer the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill back to Parliament.These would include all the legal opinions and other documents on which Zuma relied.DA finance spokesman David Maynier lodged the application last week and its receipt by the Presidency has been confirmed. He said the documents would allow him to "properly understand the process that led to the suspicious delay" by Zuma in dealing with the bill, which was passed by Parliament in May.It was only on November 28 that Zuma referred the bill back to Parliament despite repeated pleas for him to tackle it so that SA could comply with the international requirements of the Financial Action Task Force that was set up to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.The bill tightens the monitoring of financial transactions, particularly of politically influential people such as cabinet ministers, senior government officials and prominent business people.The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution had instituted legal action to force the president to take a decision on the bill, which Zuma had indicated he intended to oppose.Maynier tried last week to get the standing committee on finance to agree to his proposal to ask the Presidency for all the documents. Government departments and entities are obliged to comply with such requests from Parliament.However, ANC MP Sfiso Buthelezi did not think this was necessary as the president had outlined his reasons for sending the bill back to Parliament in a comprehensive and lengthy letter to speaker Baleka Mbete.The president said he was concerned about the constitutionality of the clause allowing for warrantless searches in certain circumstances.The Presidency s legal advisers were of the view that these circumstances were not sufficiently circumscribed and would allow for the invasion of privacy.The committee is to seek senior counsel advice on the matter and will hold public hearings late in January when Parliament reconvenes.
