Radio station owner African Media Entertainment is considering acquiring market research group Cognition and financial news service Moneyweb, the companies said in a joint statement released on Thursday after the JSE closed. African Media Entertainment, which owns Eastern Cape radio station Algoa FM and Bloemfontein-based OFM, had a market capitalisation of R603m at Thursday’s closing price of R74.85. Cognition, which changed its name from FoneWorx in March last year before turning South African computer industry market research firm BMi into a wholly owned subsidiary, had a market capitalisation of R179m at Thursday’s closing price of R1.30. Caxton subsidiary Moneyweb has a market capitalisation of R27m based on its last traded price of 25c per share. "Shareholders of the companies are advised that African Media Entertainment has lodged nonbinding expressions of interest to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Cognition and/or Moneyweb with the respective boards of directors," Thursday’s joint cautionary announcement from the three companies said.
