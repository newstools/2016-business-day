The share price of Old Mutual’s New York-listed subsidiary OM Asset Management (Omam) fell 4.91% to $14.52 after its placement price of $14.25 was announced. Old Mutual said in a statement on Wednesday both the 13-million Omam shares it was selling to the public and the 6-million shares Omam was repurchasing would be sold at $14.25 each — a 6.5% discount to the $15.25 they closed at on Monday. The underwriters have a 30-day option to buy an additional 1.95-million shares at $14.25 each, meaning Old Mutual stands to raise nearly $300m from the sale, equating to R4.1bn at Wednesday’s exchange rate of R13.64/$. At Old Mutual’s annual general meeting in June, CEO Bruce Hemphill said: "We intend to continue the phased reduction of our 65.8% holding in Omam in an orderly manner while supporting the development of its strategy, as evidenced by its recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Landmark Partners." Hemphill said that in order to advance the separation of Omam and Old Mutual, an acceleration and subsequent termination of its deferred tax asset deed and seed capital management agreement had been agreed. "This will result in Omam’s ongoing liabilities to Old Mutual under both agreements being satisfied earlier than disclosed in Omam’s initial public offering prospectus," Hemphill said in June. Old Mutual’s share price rose 1.2% to R33.86 on the JSE on Wednesday morning.
