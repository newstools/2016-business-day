The Department of Social Development and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) will soon approach the Constitutional Court to report their failure to meet most of the deadlines for the takeover of the payment of R141bn in social grants from April 1 2017.A "contingency plan" has been developed but Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini told Parliament&rsquo;s social development committee on Wednesday it could not be divulged as it would place the work under way at risk.She also said she did not want to be pushed into saying who will be paying out the grants when the invalid contract of Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) ends on March 31.Opposition parliamentarians said they suspected the lack of preparedness had been engineered to create an emergency that would require the continued use of CPS from April.The department and Sassa have had several years to prepare for the takeover but the report they gave to MPs was thin on detail.Frustrated DA MPs and ANC MP Solomon Mabilo said the lack of timelines and progress was "unacceptable", and "alarming" and they were convinced Sassa would not be ready for the takeover.About five of the deliverables mandated by the Constitutional Court had not been achieved, they said.Dlamini, department director-general Zane Dangor, and Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza insisted the grants would be paid on April 1. Dangor said the two options for grant payments under consideration involved legal issues related to CPS s invalid contract.The department had obtained three legal reports on the legal minefield and what legal steps would have to be taken were CPS to be involved in a programme to facilitate the phased-in takeover.Such involvement was obligatory for state contracts and until end-March CPS will act as an agent of the state."We are very aware of the legal issues and the risks attendant to an invalid contract," Dangor said.CPS was not envisaged as a major player in either of the two options under consideration, Dangor said.The options would have to be discussed with the Constitutional Court.The deliverables laid down by the court related to integration of systems; biometric verification and authentication; payment processing, infrastructure and reconciliation; cash distribution and security; card issuance; and special accounts.In her presentation Sassa project leader Zodwa Mvulane noted that biometric verification of social grant beneficiaries would only be ready by October 2017, one year later than the October 2016 deadline set by the Constitutional Court.A request for information on payment infrastructure and cash distribution and security systems would also only be issued in the next month.Sassa is still engaging with the Reserve Bank and participants in the National Payments System to determine whether the agency can issue cards if it is supported by banks.It has to align its biometric data with that of the Department of Home Affairs.Both payment models under consideration would involve the creation of a special Sassa social grant dispensation account that would not be a bank account that offered credit options and allowed deductions or loans.
