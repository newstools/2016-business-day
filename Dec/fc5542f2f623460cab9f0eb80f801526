Parliament&rsquo;s extension and amendments to the Employment and Learnership Tax Incentive schemes are bound to accelerate absorption of youth and graduates into the employment market, according to Business Unity SA (Busa).The business formation welcomed the changes, which Parliament adopted on Friday.These allow for the learnership tax to be extended by five years and for the employment tax incentive to be extended by two years.Amendments to the schemes include a removal of the R20m ceiling on tax incentive claims for each employer per year. Business will also be able to apply for a tax break of R30,000 for each person taken on as part of the learnership scheme.SA has a high unemployment rate (27.1%) and most of those affected are its youth. The situation has been described as a "ticking time bomb" and untenable by analysts.Moody s Investors Service, in its recent commentary on SA, flagged unemployment as a threat to stability because it would lead to more protests.Busa said: "The research demonstrated that the employment tax incentive-supported employees are paid higher wages on average, have more secure employment, and have improved prospects for skills development and employment."Economist Dawie Roodt said: "So far, we have seen studies and the results have been quite disappointing. We are completely missing the point. We need to fix the problem where the problem is and the problem lies in primary education."Roodt said while the amendments were made to ensure that businesses did not abuse the tax incentives, the changes continued to ignore the structural problems in SA s economy that continue to prevent job creation.
