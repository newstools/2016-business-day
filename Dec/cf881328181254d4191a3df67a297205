Bengaluru &mdash; Gold prices edged higher on Wednesday on a weaker dollar and as markets waited for the outcome of the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policy meeting later in the day.Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,160.50/oz by 3.23am GMT. The metal, which fell nearly 0.4% in the previous session, remained above a 10-month low of $1,151.34/oz touched on Monday. US gold futures were 0.3% higher at $1,162.40/oz.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.1% at 101."[The rise in gold prices] is because of the weaker dollar and also the anticipation of what the Fed will decide," said Brian Lan, MD at Singapore-based gold dealer GoldSilver Central."The things that will move the markets more would definitely be on how many times the Fed will raise interest rates next year."The Fed is widely expected to increase US interest rates at this week&rsquo;s Federal open market committee meeting, with investors looking for clues on the central bank&rsquo;s views on further hikes in 2017. Higher US rates raise the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.The outcome of the policy meeting will be announced at 7pm GMT, followed by chairwoman Janet Yellen&rsquo;s news conference half an hour later."We expect gold to remain on the defensive and may weaken further until the conclusion of the [Federal open market committee] meeting," HSBC analyst James Steel wrote in a note.Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world&rsquo;s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), are down more than 9% since November."ETF liquidation shows investors&rsquo; uninspired gold view. Until the &lsquo;slow bleed&rsquo; out of the ETFs ceases, it will be difficult for gold to rally," Steel added.Meanwhile, silver was up 0.2% at $16.94/oz after falling nearly 1% in the previous session.Platinum rose 0.1% to $933/oz.Palladium shed half a% to $725.72/oz, having risen about 1% on Tuesday.Reuters
