Singapore — US oil prices fell on Thursday after an industry report showed a surprise build in the country’s crude inventories while Brent futures came off early lows to trade marginally higher. US benchmark West Texas intermediate (WTI) futures were down 20c, or 0.37%, at $53.86 a barrel at 3.54am GMT after settling 16c higher at $54.06 in the previous session. Brent futures were 3c, or 0.05%, higher at $56.25 a barrel after falling 21c in early trade. They settled 13c higher at $56.22 in the previous session. Trade is expected to remain thin for the rest of the week with most investors on holiday though the expiry of the front-month February ICE Brent contract on Thursday could stir some activity in the contract. "Most investors have vested interest to keep prices high because it looks nice on the balance sheet when books close at the end of the year," said a Singapore trader. American Petroleum Institute figures out late on Wednesday showed a 4.2-million barrel build in US crude stocks in the week to December 23. Before the weekly inventory reports, analysts had forecast inventories would decline 2.1-million barrels on average. Meanwhile, a committee of Opec and non-OPEC producers responsible for monitoring compliance with a production cut agreement will meet in Vienna on January 21 and 22. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq signalled confidence on producers sticking to the agreement. Philips Futures’ investment analyst Jonathan Chan said: "Brent will be more positively impacted by the Opec and non-Opec cuts should the agreed reductions be largely adhered to over the next six months." "WTI-Brent spread will continue to widen should the Opec and Non-Opec market rebalancing initiative works out and North American Shale production continue to pick up," Chan said. Reuters
