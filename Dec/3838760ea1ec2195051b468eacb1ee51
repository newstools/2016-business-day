Bengaluru â€” Gold recovered from its lowest since early February on Friday as the dollar drifted lower ahead of US jobs data, but the metal is still on track for a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,173.76/oz by 2.48am GMT. The metal fell to its lowest since February 5 at $1,160.38 in the previous session. For the week, gold was trading down 0.7%. US gold futures gained 0.5% at $1,175.60/oz. "These movements in gold can be tied to the dollar," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. "There is a bit of buying in the physical side, but that has not been really aggressive." The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.2% on Friday to 100.850 as investors remained wary ahead of US payrolls data due later in the day. The dollar has scaled back from near 14-year highs of 102.05 hit on November 24 due to a surge in US treasury yields triggered by the expectation of higher fiscal impulse and faster pace of monetary tightening under president-elect Donald Trump. Several Federal Reserve policy makers have since expressed confidence in the US economy and signalled a possible near-term interest rate hike. Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these lift the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion, while boosting the dollar. "People are rushing to the stock market rather than the gold markets. That is evident in the liquidation we are seeing in the exchange traded funds (ETFs)," Leung of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers added. Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 1.54% to 870.22 tonnes on Thursday. Holdings fell more than 6% in November. Spot gold could bounce moderately into a range of $1,184/oz-$1,194/oz, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Silver was 0.3% higher at $16.56/oz and platinum was up 0.4% at $914.35. Both metals were on track for a first weekly rise in four weeks. Palladium gained 0.6% at $754.65/oz after scaling its highest level since June 2015 at $774.60 in the previous session. It was set to rise for a fifth consecutive week. Reuters
