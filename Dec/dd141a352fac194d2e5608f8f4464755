Singapore/Sydney &mdash; The euro fell to a 20-month low on Monday and investors fled riskier assets after Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign following a stinging defeat on constitutional reform that could destabilise the country&rsquo;s shaky banking system.Renzi&rsquo;s defeat deals a body blow to an EU already reeling under anti-establishment anger that led to the shock exit of UK from the club in June.The single currency, which opened at about $1.0685, slumped as much as 1.4% to $1.0505, its lowest since March 2015, before recovering a bit to $1.0539.The drop to its session low was the sharpest since June and opened the way to a retest of the March 2015 trough around $1.0457."It&rsquo;s not very hard to see a new election, and it&rsquo;s not very hard to see the [opposition] 5-Star Movement taking power and they&rsquo;ve basically said they want to get out of either the EU or the euro or both," said Mark Wills, head of State Street Global Advisors&rsquo; investment solutions group for the Asia-Pacific.The euro slid as much as 2.1% to &yen;118.71, but pared some of the losses to trade down 1.2% at &yen;119.73.The dollar was supported by the expectation of a US rate increase in December and gained 0.1% to &yen;113.645.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, jumped 0.7% to 101.49.The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.7091 after Prime Minister John Key unexpectedly announced his resignation on Monday, saying it was the "right time" to leave politics.New Zealand stocks extended losses to trade 0.7% lower.MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4%, while E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 narrowed losses to 0.3%. Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei slid 0.7%. While the long-awaited opening of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect went live on Monday, global risk aversion weighed on China&rsquo;s and Hong Kong&rsquo;s main indices.China&rsquo;s CSI 300 index tumbled 1.8%. Hong Kong&rsquo;s Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%. The link between China&rsquo;s booming Shenzhen stock market and neighbouring Hong Kong allows foreign investors access for the first time to some of the fastest-growing technology companies in the world&rsquo;s second-biggest economy.Back in Europe, dealers said Italian bonds were set to come under pressure as top-rated US treasuries and German bunds gained. Futures for US 10-year treasury notes added five ticks.Investors and European politicians fear the "no" camp&rsquo;s victory could cause political instability and renewed turmoil for Italy&rsquo;s banking sector, which has been hit by fears over its huge exposure to bad loans built up during years of economic downturn."Forming a stable government in Italy may be difficult, the resuscitation of [ailing lender] Monte Dei Pashci may be impacted, there is some potential that this may create an opening for a secessionist political party," said Angus Gluskie, MD of White Funds Management in Sydney.Renzi&rsquo;s resignation represents a fresh blow to the EU, which is struggling to overcome a raft of crises, and was eager for Renzi to continue his reform push in the eurozone&rsquo;s heavily indebted third-largest economy.Analysts at RBCCM argued that, based on what happened in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a eurozone crisis could see the euro trade as low as $0.8000."It may sound extreme, but if a second eurozone crisis were to hit, with the US dollar at a much stronger starting point, EUR/USD could arguably trade lower still," they wrote.Markets had earlier taken some encouragement when Austria&rsquo;s far-right presidential candidate was soundly defeated by a pro-European contender, confounding forecasts of a tight election.The European Central Bank (ECB) meets on Thursday amid much speculation it will announce a six-month extension of its asset-buying programme and widen the type of bonds it can purchase."There has been some speculation that the ECB would step and front load purchases of Italian bonds if markets became unsettled by a &lsquo;no&rsquo; result, so perhaps it is the thoughts of a central bank liquidity sugar pill driving things again," said ANZ economist Jo Masters.Oil pulls backWall Street ended on Friday on a cautious note, with the Dow off 0.11%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.04% and the Nasdaq gained 0.09%. While the US payroll report was firm enough to cement the expectation of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, a surprise pullback in wages helped bonds pare a little of their recent losses.In commodity markets, oil ran into risk aversion and some profit-taking after recording its best week in at least five years following oil cartel Opec&rsquo;s decision to cut crude output.Markets are now focused on the implementation and effect of Opec&rsquo;s first output cuts since 2008, to be joined by Russia and possibly other non-Opec producers.Brent crude was down 51c at $53.99 a barrel, while US crude lost 47c to $51.21.Reuters
