Mumbai &mdash; Keaton Jennings said scoring a century for England on his debut against India on Thursday had been a "dream come true" after waking up a bag of nerves."I woke up at 5am thinking I&rsquo;d missed the bus so I jumped out of bed and panicked about where everything was," the 24-year-old told reporters after his knock of 112."But then I settled myself down when I saw the time. If someone had told me this morning that you&rsquo;ve got a Test match hundred I would have bitten their arm off."It&rsquo;s been a dream come true, and just surreal that it&rsquo;s come on debut," Jennings said.The South African-born opener guided England to a solid start of 288/5 in the first innings of their must-win fourth Test at Mumbai&rsquo;s Wankhede Stadium.The left-hander was almost caught while still to get off the mark and took until the 12th ball to get his first runs on the board &mdash; but when he did there was no stopping the tall opener."When the ball looped up to gully, my heart was in my mouth and I thought: &lsquo;No, you got a nought in your first innings&rsquo;, but thankfully, it went to ground and I went from there," he said.Jennings hit 13 fours including a trio of audacious reverse sweeps during his 219-ball stay.It was one of those sweeps that brought up his ton midway through the afternoon session, with Jennings raising his hand in delight at the score."The emotion that went over me at that moment in time, the elation, the pride, the satisfaction to go to a Test 100 was really incredible, really special."Jennings, who was only called up to the squad after Haseeb Hameed suffered a broken finger in the third Test, put on a partnership of 99 with captain Alastair Cook.Cook was stumped on 46 by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel after swinging at a delivery by Ravindra Jadeja.Joe Root could only make 21 runs before he was caught at slip by Indian captain Virat Kohli off a spinning delivery by Ravichandran Ashwin.Moeen Ali helped guide Jennings to his ton and scored a half century himself before hopelessly scooping up an Ashwin delivery that landed comfortably in the hands of Karun Nair.Jennings walked soon afterwards when Cheteshwar Pujara caught a little flick off the bat for Ashwin&rsquo;s third wicket of the day, and England were on 230/4.
