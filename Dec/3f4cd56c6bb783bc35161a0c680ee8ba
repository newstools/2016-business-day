Singapore — The safe-haven Japanese yen held on to gains on Tuesday, with investors spooked after deadly incidents in Germany and Turkey, while regional stocks were mixed following upbeat comments from Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept monetary policy steady as widely expected, maintaining its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan pared earlier gains to trade little changed. Japan’s Nikkei was flat. Reduced volumes ahead of the Christmas holidays tempered buying in some Asian markets. China’s CSI 300 index slid 0.4%, and Taiwan shares retreated 0.3%. Hong Kong shares reversed earlier losses to trade little changed. Wall Street ended higher on Monday, albeit below the session’s highs, as optimism over Yellen’s upbeat comments about the US labour market offset some of the risk aversion following the attacks. "Yellen painted a very positive picture in her commentary overnight," said James Woods, global investment strategist at Rivkin Securities in Sydney. "The [Federal open market committee] has done a fantastic job preparing the market for this second and subsequent hikes. Importantly they have continued to stress that the [committee] remains data dependent, only hiking when the underlying fundamentals of the economy support this." Still, markets were rattled after a truck ploughed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday evening, killing 12 people and injuring 48 others in what Germany’s interior minister said looked like an attack. The euro, which slid 0.5% to $1.0401 on Monday, recovered 0.1% to $1.04125 on Tuesday. The euro was also pressured after the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was shot and killed at an art gallery in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The Turkish lira was steady at 3.532 against the dollar on Tuesday after falling 0.7% on Monday. The rouble was also little changed on Tuesday at 61.8115 to the dollar. It slumped to as low as 62.0907 against the dollar on Monday but recovered to end the day up 0.3% at 61.8475. The flight to safety following both incidents boosted the Japanese yen, although it pared some of the gains as the dollar strengthened after Yellen’s comments. The US dollar, which fell as much as 1.2% on Monday against the yen, ended the session down 0.7% at ¥117.205 yen. It was steady at ¥117.21 on Tuesday. The US dollar has risen 11.4% versus the yen since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory. Trump formally won the presidency after the Electoral College gave him more than the 270 votes required to be elected. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, climbed 0.2% on Monday after Yellen’s upbeat labour market assessment. It was 0.1% lower at 103.05 on Tuesday. Gold, which rose 0.4% on Monday, was little changed at $1,138.45/oz on Tuesday. Oil pulled back on Tuesday as traders began to unwind positions in the run-up to the holiday season. US crude slid 0.4% to $51.92 a barrel after closing up 0.4% on Monday. Global benchmark Brent slipped 0.2% to $54.82. Reuters
