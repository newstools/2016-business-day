Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler has numerous admirers and one of his biggest fans will be in the opposing dugout when his charges line up against SuperSport United in the final of the Telkom Knockout at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Saturday.United coach Stuart Baxter revealed in the build-up to the final that he was a Tinkler fan&sbquo; but given what will be at stake&sbquo; the City coach would do well to remain focused and not allow the praise to go to his head.The club was launched 162 days ago and Baxter said he was not surprised that not only had Tinkler led City to the final&sbquo; but the newcomers were top of the premiership standings.&lsquo;&lsquo;I am not surprised because I think Eric is one of the young coaches in this country that has a bright future&sbquo;" Baxter said. He has done a lot and I thought he really did a good job when he was at [Orlando] Pirates. Whenever you talk to him about the game, he knows what he is talking about. He has got belief in what he is doing. He has come to an open book now with Cape Town City. It is like a new start for him and for them."City are in the midst of a purple patch and Tinkler has managed to mould them into a formidable unit.Saturday s final will give Tinkler an opportunity to get his own back on Baxter as he was the coach of the losing side when a Baxter-led United beat Pirates 3-2 in the final of the Nedbank Cup in May.He will hope his move from Pirates to City during the PSL off-season will bring a change in fortune as the Bucs stumbled in the last hurdle and lost in the finals of the Confederation Cup and the Nedbank Cup with him at the helm.Tinkler did taste success in cup competitions as an assistant coach and won the Nedbank Cup with Wits under head coach Roger de Sa in 2010 and again with Pirates under Vladimir Vermezovic in 2014.The City coach will go to Polokwane with some reservations as he is not happy that the final will be played there."I don t know how neutral it is " complained Tinkler this week. "I m not entirely happy with the venue because I think it is difficult for us and our fans to get there."The two coaches claimed this week that their most influential players Lehlohonolo Majoro for City and Jeremy Brockie and Bradley Grobler for United were doubtful starters and could miss the game through injury. But it could all just be mind games. Jeremy is a probable and Bradley is a possible " claimed Baxter, while Tinkler said: "[Majoro] is injured and won t be available for the final."We will know soon enough&nbsp;if this is indeed the case.TMG Digital
