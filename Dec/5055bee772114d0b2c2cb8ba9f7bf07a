The JSE opened flat in muted trade on Tuesday after the Dow Jones recorded yet another record high on Monday. Gold miners led the pack, with industrials marginally higher. Property stocks recovered further. At 9.35am the all share had added 0.05% to 50,551.80 points and the blue-chip top 40 was up 0.09%. The gold index added 0.48% and industrials 0.26%. Platinums lost 0.66% and resources 0.49%. In Asia the Nikkei 225 was up 0.50% and the Hang Seng fell 0.17%. The Dow closed 0.20% firmer at 19,796.43 points on Monday, but trading was subdued for most of the day ahead of Federal Reserveâ€™s rate decision on Wednesday. "Traders were reluctant to take huge outright positions ahead of the Fed rate decision despite an overwhelming consensus for a hike," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. Spot gold and platinum were flat to marginally lower, but Brent crude continued its upward path, firming 0.45% to R55.57 a barrel. Higher oil prices mean higher imported inflation for the local economy. But analysts are doubtful that higher oil prices are sustainable as they are likely to attract dormant producers to re-enter the market. According to latest data, the number of active oil rigs in the world increased in response to the recent price rise, with US shale oil producers leading the rise in the rig count. "Any further increases in the oil price would further incentivise shale oil activity in the US, which may gain market share from oil cartel Opec and non-Opec producers," Nedbank said. Although higher oil prices generally benefit commodities, resources took a breather on Tuesday morning, with Anglo American dropping 1.09% to R210 and BHP Billiton falling 0.65% to R241.69. Sasol was 0.76% weaker at R396.30. Among industrials, Bidvest rose 1.22% to R176.85. Sibanye still showed a muted reaction to the Stillwater deal, gaining a marginal 0.37% to R24.20. It has lost 16.5% so far in December. Among financials, Liberty Holdings was 2.05% lower at R106.96. Redefine was 1.06% up at R10.53. New Europe Property Investments was 0.78% lower at R151.09 but Rockcastle gained 1.14% to R34.69. The two groups are in possible merger talks. Life Healthcare was 2.59% lower at R31.27. Allied Electronics rose 5.45% to R9.29. Niche financial group Anchor slipped 3.09% to R9.09.
