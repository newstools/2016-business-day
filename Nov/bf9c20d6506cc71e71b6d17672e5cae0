Next year&rsquo;s facelift of Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s flagship S-Class limousine will usher in a new range of V8, in-line six-cylinder and four-cylinder engines.The new powertrains won&rsquo;t stay with the S-Class though, with a modular range of petrol and diesel engines set to sprinkle throughout the range.Based around modular 500cc single-cylinder architecture, the all-new engines will all use turbocharging and will range from in-line fours to in-line sixes and an AMG-developed 4.0l biturbo V8.The all-new engines will include a 2.0l, four-cylinder turbodiesel, a 3.0l turbodiesel, a twin-scroll four-cylinder petrol engine and an in-line turbocharged petrol-powered six-cylinder engine, along with the M176 V8.Aimed at improving performance and slashing real-world NOx and CO2 emissions, the new engines will benefit from unprecedented economies of scale, sharing components and production facilities.For the first time at Mercedes, all four new engines have been designed from scratch to work with hybrid electric power as Benz battles to keep its internal combustion knowledge relevant under tougher emissions laws in a looming electrified future."The optimisation of advanced hi-tech engines plays a key role in our road map towards sustainable mobility," Daimler research and development boss Thomas Weber says."For the mobility of the future, we are deliberately not committing ourselves to one solitary form of drive system but to a coexistence of efficient and clean petrol engines, diesels, plug-in hybrids, battery and hydrogen drive systems."Hi-tech engines and electrification are not in competition with each other. On the contrary, they complement each other perfectly in many applications."The range will be headed by the 4.0l M176 V8, which will power the S500 and replace its sweet 4.6l M278 powerplant by delivering more power, more torque, lower emission levels and reduced fuel consumption.The new engine is derived from the V8s in the AMG E63 and the GT coupe and will deliver more than 350kW of power and around 700Nm when it reaches production towards the middle of 2017.With between 100 and 200 bar of fuel pressure and two turbochargers nestled in between the cylinder banks, it will also have the ability to shut down four cylinders, two on each bank, to effectively run as a V4 in light load situations.It will usher in an era of 48V power for Merc, which will see its Integrated Starter-Alternator (ISG) and electric auxiliary compressor (eZV), which boosts up 70,000r/min in just 300 milliseconds. Together, the two systems act as a hybrid-lite, delivering an extra 10kW to 15kW of boosting performance when it is needed to cover for either turbo lag or spool-up.Benz isn&rsquo;t giving away the S500&rsquo;s performance data yet but insists its fuel economy will be 10% lower than the current car with the new V8 in place. Emissions should also improve, with Benz making a cordierite particulate filter standard on some petrol engines from next year.The S-Class will receive the in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, dubbed M256 internally and boasting more than 300kW of power. While Benz isn&rsquo;t making specific performance claims for the car, it will have more than 500Nm of torque, giving it 20% more power and 4% more torque than the current V6.It uses both a single turbocharger and the ISG and eZV with a 15% reduction in engine-related CO2 and highlighting the 90mm bore spacings of the new modular engine family.The first of the new engines out of Benz&rsquo;s &euro;3bn powertrain investment programme was the OM654 four-cylinder turbodiesel, which debuted in the E220d this year. It&rsquo;s not as advanced as the unit planned for the S-Class, which will have more than 230kW of power and more than 650Nm of torque. Its consumption figures are claimed to be down 7% over the outgoing 3.0l V6 turbodiesel.The investment in the new engine families included an astonishing new Powertrain Integration Centre in Sindelfingen, Germany, which can house 10 full cars or prototypes, running 24 hours a day with or without drivers.The cells are all self-fuelling and include four exhaust test benches, three application roller test benches, three powertrain test benches and two cold-start chambers."It&rsquo;s the most modern test bench facility in the automotive industry and it plays an important part in helping us reach our goal of taking more and more testing off the road and onto the test stand," Daimler&rsquo;s director of gasoline and hybrid powertrain, Mario Murwald, says."In Sindelfingen alone we have invested about &euro;600m in large-scale test rigs and research and development facilities."The highlights include high-precision torque measurement directly at the axles, the climatic altitude chamber that enables us to simulate an altitude of up to 5,000m, fully automatic operation minus driver, full temperature and humidity adjustment, automatic refuelling and 98% of electrical brake energy fed back into the grid."The cells can each run between -30C&deg; and +42C&deg; and can manage diesel, petrol, fuel cell or battery electric vehicle and compressed natural gas, though only the petrol and diesel models can be refuelled automatically."All the manoeuvres can be done on the road but the test bench gives us several advantages," explains Verena Ricke of Daimler&rsquo;s powertrain testing department."We can change driving modes; decelerating, braking, changing gear, 24 hours a day. We can simulate different responses of the accelerator pedal, for example, without taking the car off the road."One of the great advantages is the reproducibility because there is no rain or heat changes and we can keep all the conditions stable."The rolling test benches can cope with 500kW of power (330kW for the rear roller) and are flexible enough to take any wheelbase or track width in the current or future Mercedes-Benz armoury.Its engine test benches are unique in the industry, bolting directly to wheel-extending bolts to give unprecedented accuracy, with electric power capable of soaking up 270kW of power and 4,000Nm of torque per wheel."We have highly precise torque measurements and fine control of the machine, so we can test any longitudinal test you can dream up with this," Marcus Sonntag, Daimler s head of valuation and measurements, says."Compared to testing on the road, the test bench allows us to have an early evaluation at the highest level of precision."Of course you have to say that we can never replace road testing completely."
