The state entity entrusted with SA&rsquo;s water security has devised a funding strategy for phase two of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which includes bank loans and going to market.Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority CEO Leonard Radzuma told Business Day at the entity&rsquo;s results presentation on Friday that state guarantees to back its capital funding-raising efforts were still to be discussed with the Treasury.The state-owned water and infrastructure entity is the implementing agent for most bulk water infrastructure projects in SA, including the multi-year acid-mine drainage project that is ongoing in Gauteng.It falls under the Department of Water and Sanitation.Its results for the year to March show cash flows rose to R7.46bn from R7bn in 2015 because of a rise in water volumes and a 9% tariff hike.Across all projects, bonds form two-thirds of the authority&rsquo;s funding, with commercial banks providing 29%.Phase two, estimated to cost R23bn, will consist of augmenting water supply to SA.The first phase, completed in 2003 at a cost of R16.4bn, delivered 780-million cubic metres of water annually. Phase two is expected to be completed in 2024 and to deliver 1.2-billion cubic metres of water.However, this phase has been hampered by delays amid allegations of departmental impropriety over contracting.The entity generates the bulk of its revenue from tariffs charged on water use in the Vaal River System, which is under pressure following a year of little rain. The Vaal River System has 14 dams, and serves Gauteng, Sasol and Eskom. But its levels are dangerously low.Radzuma said while drought may affect water volumes, and by implication the authority s revenue, it was too soon to speculate on this.Professor Anthony Turton, of the Centre for Environmental Management at the University of the Free State, said Gauteng had "dodged a bullet" after receiving rainfall over the past 10 days. The Vaal River System was close to "complete systemic collapse".The entity remained a sophisticated institution with a long record of successful projects, but delays in the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project meant Gauteng would be water-insecure until the mid-2020s, he said.
