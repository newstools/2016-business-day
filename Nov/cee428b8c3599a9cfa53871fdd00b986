Details of the hearing will be announced in due course," the ICC said in a statement.Fox Sports aired footage of Du Plessis taken during the second Test, which showed him polishing the ball using fingers taken from his mouth in which an object that could be a sweet is visible.The 18-hour window the match officials had to take action closed without them doing so, putting the matter in the ICC s hands.Reuters, with Telford Vice
