Tongaat Hulett on Monday reported a 4% rise in first-half headline earnings to R631m, which matched its recent guidance. The financial performance was primarily bolstered by the sugar operations, which more than compensated for a disappointing performance in the land conversion and developments segment. Operating profit in various sugar operations jumped to R825m in the six months to August from R477m in the year-earlier period, reflecting improved local prices, the benefits of import protection in select geographies, such as Mozambique, and higher international prices. The mid-cap company cautioned, however, that overall volumes were still being affected by lower cane yields due to the drought in KwaZulu-Natal and poor growing conditions and restricted irrigation levels in Mozambique and Zimbabwe due to low dam levels. The estimate for total sugar production for 2016-17 was between 1-million tonnes and 1.10-million tonnes, compared with 1.02-million tonnes last year. Operating profit in the land conversion and development activities more than halved to R269m from R576m. The starch and glucose operation increased operating profit to R306m from R281m as it benefited from a better sales mix. The group revenue was up 11% to R8.8bn but its interim dividend slid to 100c per share from 170c in the year-earlier period. The stock has risen 25% on the JSE in 2016, valuing the company at R17.5bn.
