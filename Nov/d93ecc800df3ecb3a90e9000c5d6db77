The willingness of banks to find ways to relieve the financial burden of indebted clients is evident, but the jury is still out as to whether this needs to be backed up by enforcement measures.These comments by National Credit Regulator CEO Nomsa Motshegare came after presentations by banks on their approach to debt relief to Parliament&rsquo;s trade and industry portfolio committee.The committee is investigating whether debt relief is necessary and if provision for it should be embodied in an act.A subcommittee has been set up to look into the matter and portfolio committee chairwoman Joan Fubbs is hopeful it will finalise its report before the end of the parliamentary session in December.Nedbank, Standard Bank, Absa, First Rand, Capitec and African Bank made submissions to the committee, largely supporting the Banking Association SA&rsquo;s view that banks need flexibility to deal with individuals on a case-by-case basis. A prescriptive law or regulation would remove this.Motshegare said the presentations indicated a willingness to address the problem, which had seen impaired accounts rising to 20.2-million, or 24% of all accounts, as at the end of June.The regulator and the Department of Trade and Industry have drafted amendments to the National Credit Act to effect debt forgiveness and to extend the powers of the regulator to conduct proactive investigations and audits, and to settle cases."We can see there is a willingness on the part of the banks, which are already doing some sort of debt relief outside of the National Credit Act &hellip; with the use of the debt restructuring rules system, which allows them to provide concessions to indebted consumers, such as reducing interest rates."But at the same time, we need to ensure we can force them to do what they have agreed to do if they do not perform. We don&rsquo;t want people to make promises &hellip; only to find out later that nothing comes out of it," Motshegare said."We need to find a way of forcing them to implement what they promised to do. And this is what might have to go into the bill," she said.Standard Bank personal and business banking CE Thabani Ndwandwe noted that, among the instruments used to assist overindebted clients, were short-term repayment moratoria, debt restructurings and debt consolidation.The bank also had dedicated programmes to assist students.He said blanket legislative measures could create uncertainty and slow down the bank s own initiatives."There is a lot of reckless lending in the market and that should be dealt with [using] existing laws; we don t need new laws," he said.However, inefficiencies in the debt-review process system needed to be addressed and it needed to be made more accessible to the poor.Absa customer solutions CE Jan Moganwa said the National Credit Act had done a lot to improve practices and the treatment of customers. He warned that overregulation could drive customers into the unregulated lending market.Nedbank head of credit risk management and monitoring Pragnesh Desai outlined the measures the bank used to help clients in financial distress. The bank would not support a one-size-fits-all debt-relief strategy.
