The opposition will pile the pressure on President Jacob Zuma when he appears in the National Assembly this week. The president is set to be asked if he had spurred on two ministers to interdict the State of Capture report.DA leader Mmusi Maimane will on Wednesday ask Zuma if he and/or his legal team had instructed Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and/or Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen to lodge applications to interdict the release of the report "due to the specified persons&rsquo; alleged relationships with the Gupta family; if not, in each case, what is the position in this regard; if so, what are the reasons in each case".The African Christian Democratic Party&rsquo;s Steve Swart will ask whether Zuma has found that "sufficient steps have been taken by the government to satisfy the concerns expressed by sovereign ratings agencies earlier in 2016 to avoid a sovereign ratings downgrade in their next review".The president is under pressure from segments of the ANC, the tripartite alliance, civil society formations and opposition parties. ANC veterans want Zuma to go. ANC chief whip and national executive committee member Jackson Mthembu has called on the president to do the right thing. MP Mathole Motshekga has made a similar call.Two Cosatu affiliates the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union and the Communication Workers Union have called on Zuma to step down.SaveSA, spearheaded by ANC veteran and Anglo American chairman Sipho Pityana, is planning silent protests around key events in the next six months most notably on December 10 (Constitution Day), February 2017 s state of the nation address, and on April 27 (Freedom Day). On Wednesday, the movement will institute a "people s motion of no confidence" against Zuma.The ANC parliamentary caucus was left with egg on its face last week when it failed to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill during a second attempt.Failure to pass the bill has stalled the release of crucial funds to state institutions.A total of 17 ANC MPs missed a National Assembly sitting last week without leave, which left the party without a quorum to adopt the bill.The party is expecting it to be third time lucky this week.The bill will be resubmitted to the National Assembly for adoption and no ANC MP or minister will be given leave of absence, Mthembu said.The bill, which was tabled by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with the medium-term budget policy statement in October, provides for a R5.41bn adjustment to the budget and its passing is important for the continued funding of government programmes.Department of Basic Education officials will on Wednesday brief MPs on the "jobs-for-cash" report.The report paints the South African Democratic Teachers Union in a negative light and notes the department only has control in three provinces the Western Cape, the Northern Cape and the Free State.The DA is back in court on Tuesday and Wednesday to have Hlaudi Motsoeneng s appointment as group executive of corporate affairs at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) invalidated.The party argues Motsoeneng is not a fit and proper person to hold any senior position at the SABC.
