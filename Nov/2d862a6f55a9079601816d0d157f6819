It was not the calls for a boycott of the ANN7 South African of the Year Awards that led to the show being cancelled&sbquo; but rather major banking woes involving the Gupta family.Last week ANN7 confirmed that the show would not go ahead&sbquo; despite the channel saying it had arranged for international singing sensation Jennifer Lopez to perform.The EFF led calls to boycott the show, insisting that the Gupta family wanted to "legitimise their criminal activities in SA".Just a few days later&sbquo; the channel released a statement confirming that the South African of the Year Awards had been postponed."The postponement is due to unforeseen regulatory circumstances that have materially impacted on logistics for the event. Regretfully&sbquo; this has left us with no choice but to seek a new date in the near future. We look forward to confirming a rescheduled date&sbquo;" read a statement at the time.Now City Press is reporting that the Gupta family has been receiving help from India&rsquo;s Bank of Baroda after being dumped by major banks in SA.However&sbquo; that relationship has come under "increased scrutiny".The paper claims that officials at the bank refused to release funds on time."The bank did not release the funds to pay artists and other expenses&sbquo;" on source told the paper.At the same time sources have told TshisaLIVE that plans for the concert to take place in April 2017 have already begun.TMG Digital
