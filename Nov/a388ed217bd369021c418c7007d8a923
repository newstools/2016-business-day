The Claasen Board of Inquiry into suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega&rsquo;s fitness to hold office has completed its report."The said report will be handed over to the president on a date determined by the president," inquiry chairman Judge Neels Claassen said on Monday.The hearings were concluded on June 3.In September last year, President Jacob Zuma announced that a board of inquiry had been appointed to look into allegations of misconduct against Phiyega.On October 14, the president suspended Phiyega.This followed the release of the Farlam commission report, which recommended that Phiyega face an inquiry into her fitness to hold office.The Farlam commission, headed by retired judge Ian Farlam, had investigated the deaths of 44 people killed at the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana in Rustenburg in August 2012 during strike-related unrest.In July this year, Phiyega applied to the High Court in Pretoria to review and set aside the Farlam report recommendations.
