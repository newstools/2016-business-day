Outgoing Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has turned down staff pleas that he remain at the utility after his surprise resignation.Staff members called an impromptu meeting on Tuesday at Eskom&rsquo;s Megawatt Park headquarters in Sunninghill, Johannesburg, at which they asked Molefe to stay on.Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the meeting was organised by "guardians", who are part of Eskom staff and belong to various unions.The National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA and Solidarity said they were aware of the meeting but were still gathering more information about it.Molefe, who had to cancel an appointment to attend the meeting, addressed the group about his reasons for resigning.He made the same utterances he had put in a statement released on Friday, in which he detailed why he had to step down from Eskom.Molefe again said he was not resigning because of wrongdoing but felt he had to do so in the interest of the company. He also wanted to clear his name.Molefe was dealt with in former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report, which sketches a picture of the Eskom CEO s close ties with the Gupta family.Phasiwe said the workers wanted him to stay as "he was able to turn around the company and they had high hopes he was going to stay on and continue to change the company".The group said it would write a letter to the board, which would send it to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, asking her not to accept Molefe s resignation.However, Brown and the board have already accepted Molefe s resignation. No board member attended the meeting.Matshela Koko, Eskom s group executive for generation, said he had spoken to Molefe after the meeting and the CEO was adamant about his decision. Koko said he hoped Molefe would at least consider the staff members request.
