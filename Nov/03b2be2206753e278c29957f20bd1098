Felicia Mphamu, 25, of Pretoria, qualified under the new rules of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a drone pilot for her father&rsquo;s aerial inspection company and is one of the future faces of the burgeoning drone industry in SA.But although the industry&rsquo;s global worth is predicted by PricewaterhouseCoopers to skyrocket over the next three years from $2bn to $127bn, the new CAA regulations, introduced on July 1 last year, were shot down at SA&rsquo;s first drone conference last Thursday for being prohibitively expensive, tangled in red tape and inhibiting business innovation.Mphamu&rsquo;s father, William Morule, founded Mowiti Construction and Projects in 2006. The small company specialises in aerial powerline, pipeline and stockpile inspections and uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) &mdash; or drones &mdash; mounted with cameras as a cost-effective alternative to helicopters.Once the preserve of the military, drones have become relatively inexpensive and accessible to civilian fliers, opening up scores of business applications.But following the police detention of a man in June 2013 for operating a drone outside former president Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s hospital window, the CAA came under pressure and issued a warning, threatening fines of up to R50,000 or a 10-year prison term, or both, for "illegal" drone operators.The film, advertising, conservation and civil engineering industries, and innovators such as Mowiti, had already been operating drones for some time, and so they lobbied the CAA on its new regulations. But the kinks have yet to be ironed out.Under the 15-step CAA process, companies wanting to fly drones need to acquire a Remotely Piloted Aerial System Operator Certificate (ROC). Additionally, each pilot needs to qualify for their Remote Pilot&rsquo;s Licence (RPL), and each drone needs to be registered.Although Mphamu acquired her RPL within two months, it cost Mowiti R30,000.The ROC licensing, which her father says can take up to a year, is still being processed and he estimates it will cost his company &mdash; which has a turnover of R1m a year &mdash; another R150,000-R170,000 in fees to the CAA. This excludes the quality management and safety courses he paid for his staff.Film-maker FC Hamman told the conference of 150 delegates he had almost bankrupted himself spending up to R500,000 to get his Cape Town company and its pilots licensed. He claimed his was one of only eight companies that had managed to get their ROC since the rules came into effect, and that about 280 drone pilots had been licensed so far.The result, he warned, was that many reputable companies &mdash; and even some government departments &mdash; were saving on costs and skipping the red tape by flying drones illegally and often unsafely.The CAA rules are quite simple, comparable to those that came into effect under the Federal Aviation Authority in the US on August 30.Drones and pilots have to be licensed, have to fly under 400ft (121m) and outside a 10km radius of any aerodrome, and have to be operated within radio visual line of sight. But there is confusion in the details.The manual that expands on the rules allows for the classification of drones in SA by a calculation that takes into account the drone&rsquo;s maximum take-off weight, maximum impact velocity and so forth &ndash; but does not supply a table showing the resulting classifications.And in what appears to be an error, the example of a 7kg drone given for the calculation in the manual is cited in the regulation as the maximum take-off weight allowed.This is made nonsense by the fact that SA produces some large drones, such as the aircraft-sized Viper 1000c, made by Midrand s Ultimate Unmanned, which weighs 1.1 tonnes.The Viper points to another gap in the regulations: it flies well beyond radio visual line of sight, and is entirely autonomous in take-off, flight and landing, so does not qualify as a remotely piloted aerial system, as UAVs are envisaged by the rules.In a clause that will doubtlessly be challenged by industry and in contrast to the new UAV regulations in Britain and Rwanda, and those expected soon in Kenya drones may not be used to "release, dispense, drop, deliver or deploy" any object or substance.This effectively outlaws the use in South African airspace of cargo drones such as DHL s Paketkopter, Amazon s Prime Air, or the development of any local equivalents.The industry has teething problems that also need consideration. Jaco Schoeman of Drone Ops told the conference that while drones using infrared optics were of great use to farmers in detecting poor crop quality, or soil and contour problems, they were unlikely to revolutionise commercial farming as the analyses they provide had to be supplemented by field tests and interventions that required feet on the ground.Still, he recognised their uses for insurers accurately to assess crop losses.Duncan Osborne of CC&amp;A Insurance Brokers said drone risk assessments were similar to those for motor vehicles revolving around the age, experience and track record of pilots, and the use to which the drones would be put.Devon Hasenbroek of RocketMine said while the mining industry has used drones successfully to counter copper cable theft, monitor stockpile movements and identify unseen fires within combustible stockpiles, it was still three to five years away from possessing drones with the range and endurance to monitor an entire mine in a single flight.And although drones had been touted as a great anti-poaching tool, John Monk of CSIR Defence, Peace, Safety and Security said 2014 tests with the Denel Dynamics Hungwe UAV had showed it was "incredibly difficult to see poachers in the bush", so the technology was best used for monitoring poachers already detected by conventional tracking.Conference organiser Sean Reitz of United Drone Holdings says he is planning next year s event, earmarked for three days in June, that would allow for many more exhibitors and flying demonstrations.
