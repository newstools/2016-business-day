The Gupta family and the public protector&rsquo;s State of Capture report will again feature when President Jacob Zuma makes his last appearance for the year in Parliament, on Wednesday.First up is the UDM leader Bantu Holomisa&rsquo;s question about whether Zuma "has applied his mind to the proposal of the interministerial committee &hellip; to look into the closure of the accounts of Oakbay Investments".Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane chaired this committee&sbquo; and controversially issued a statement on September 1 in which he called for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the termination of financial services to Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments.The following day the Presidency said Zwane s statement was issued in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the Cabinet.Zwane also features in DA leader Mmusi Maimane s question to Zuma.He wants to know if the president "and/or his legal team instructed" Zwane and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen "to lodge applications to interdict the release of the public protector s report entitled State of Capture due to the specified persons alleged relationships with the Gupta family?"Zwane and Van Rooyen both dropped their court bids to halt the issuing of the report as did Zuma in the face of a legal challenge by four political parties.The Presidency said in a statement that Wednesday s "session will complete the President s cycle of questions in Parliament for 2016 after he appeared in the National Council of Provinces for oral replies on October 25 2016".TMG Digital
