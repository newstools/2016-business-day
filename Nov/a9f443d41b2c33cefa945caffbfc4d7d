Rockwell Diamonds has won the first of a number of court cases brought against it by a disgruntled contractor that was building a processing plant and conducting mining for the company in the Northern Cape.The alluvial diamond miner, which has run into stiff financial headwinds, faces a number of court cases from C-Rock Mining, which alleges non-payment of millions of rand in bills and is seeking liquidation of Rockwell and a number of its operating subsidiaries.Chief executive Tjaart Willemse, who took over the reins last month, has contested the veracity of C-Rock&rsquo;s claims. He says the matter must be heard in court and that a former senior employee entered into inappropriate commercial transactions.On Wednesday, Rockwell said it had won a spoliation case brought against it by C-Rock. A spoliation order, if granted, would have returned mining vehicles and equipment to the contractor. However, the court decided in Rockwell&rsquo;s favour, Willemse said.The Kimberley High Court dismissed C-Rock&rsquo;s spoliation application with costs, Willemse said."This decision clears the way for the company to resume its mining activities, which is expected to happen before the weekend," he said."Rockwell continues to pursue additional legal processes to deal with damages and other related contracts as well as matters arising from the forensic review, as reported on 24 November, 2016," he said.The company has put its Remhoogte and Holsloot properties up for sale, as well as its near-depleted Saxendrift mine.It will focus on its Wouterspan mine, which should deliver 200,000 tonnes of diamond-bearing gravels a month.Rockwell is raising $8m from key investors, which include Mark Bristow, who chairs the company that is listed in Toronto and Johannesburg. The money will be used to bring Wouterspan into steady state production.
