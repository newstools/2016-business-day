New York &mdash; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is no longer selling Welspun India sheets that were labelled as 100% Egyptian cotton, dealing another setback to a bedding supplier embroiled in a scandal about the origin of its products.Welspun shares fell as much as 9% in Mumbai on Tuesday.Based on an independent audit of Welspun&rsquo;s Perfect Touch and Crowning Touch sheets, the Indian supplier was unable to guarantee that the fibres were actually Egyptian cotton. That led Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to stop selling the sheets, spokeswoman Leah Drill said in an e-mail."We are extremely disappointed in these findings," she said. "While the sheets are safe to use, as with any product we sell, customers who are dissatisfied can return the sheets to any one of our stores for a refund or store credit."The move follows Target&rsquo;s announcement in August that it was severing ties with Welspun.Target said at the time that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases that were labeled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton, kicking off a controversy that has reverberated through the industry.Wal-Mart Stores also stopped selling Welspun&rsquo;s E gyptian cotton sheets over concern about the products&rsquo; origin.Consumers often pay a premium for Egyptian-cotton products because they are perceived to be softer and more durable. Sheets made from cotton grown in other countries do not always carry the same cachet.Bloomberg
