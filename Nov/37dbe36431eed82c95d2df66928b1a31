ArcelorMittal’s Vanderbijlpark works suffered from an electricity outage and poor quality raw materials, while output from its Saldanha works fell due to planned maintenance during the September quarter. In its production update released on Tuesday, ArcelorMittal called on the government to "protect the downstream industry from cheap imports of finished and semi-finished products that continue to be imported into the country". Flat steel production from the South African operations of the world’s largest steel maker fell 21% in the quarter to 712,000 tonnes from the June quarter, and was 7.8% lower than the matching quarter in 2015. Long steel production was 403,000 tonnes during the September quarter, 3.9% higher than the June quarter but 1.7% down from the previous year. Export steel sales plunged 64% to 136,000 from the previous year, and 38% from the previous quarter. ArcelorMittal said exports suffered from weak international demand that was compounded by the strengthening of the average rand-dollar exchange rate in the quarter and the oversupply of steel in the global market. Local steel sales of 814,000 tonnes was 10.5% lower than the previous quarter, but 2.5% higher than the previous year. "Although having declined slightly from 2015 levels, imports are still high despite the 10% duties having been imposed. The need for additional protection through safeguards is therefore imperative to address the surge in imports," the company said in its production update.
