Parliament&rsquo;s joint standing committee on intelligence has selected Setlhomamaru Dintwe as its preferred candidate for the position of inspector-general of intelligence, the legislature announced on Thursday.The former head of the police practice department at the University of SA was chosen out of 10 final candidates who were interviewed by the standing committee earlier in November.Dintwe also served as a deputy director of policy and research in the Gauteng Provincial Department of Community Safety.During his interview, Dintwe said the office of the inspector-general of intelligence could not compromise on its independence.The inspector-general of intelligence is a key position&sbquo; and the incumbent acts to ensure that the country&rsquo;s security agents act within the law.In an item listed among Parliament&rsquo;s announcements on Thursday, the committee highlighted its selection process."The best performing candidate during the interviews was Dr Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe who impressed all the members of the subcommittee."The joint standing committee on intelligence, therefore, unanimously nominates him for consideration by the National Assembly, for recommendation to the president for appointment as the inspector-general of intelligence," the committee said.The initial selection process took place in February 2015 when eight candidates, including former ANC MP Cecil Burgess, were short-listed.The position has been vacant for over a year because the ANC&sbquo; which lacked a two-thirds majority on its own&sbquo; wanted to install Burgess&sbquo; who gained notoriety for pushing the Secrecy Bill through Parliament&sbquo; in the position.Opposition parties refused to budge despite special lobbying on Burgess&rsquo;s behalf by&sbquo; among others&sbquo; National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and State Security Minister David Mahlobo. Thus the ANC could not muster the required votes.In the new selection process the DA, along with lobby group Right2Know, objected to closed interviews, resulting in an open process.With Jan-Jan Joubert&nbsp;
