Donald Trump&rsquo;s shock win of the US presidency sparked a surprising rally on Wall Street last week that some believe may be a prelude to further gains.The response, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial record to new highs on Thursday and Friday, reflected expectations that pro-business policies and ramped-up public works spending would spur greater economic growth.Analysts said the market&rsquo;s optimistic response was reasonable, but that there were also risks ahead."There s a lot of expectations built into this rally," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.But for stocks to go higher, companies would have to show much stronger profit and revenue growth, he said.The Dow had its best week in five years, ending Friday at 18,847.66, to take its gain since January above 8%.The broader S&amp;P 500, pulled down by energy stocks, was still about 1% below its all-time high a far cry from the cataclysmic reaction to Trump s success in the presidential election some analysts had predicted.AFP
