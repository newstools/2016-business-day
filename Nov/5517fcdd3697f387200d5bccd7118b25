The release in December of the final draft of the third iteration of the Mining Charter has pushed the Chamber of Mines&rsquo; patience to breaking point, prompting CEO Roger Baxter to deliver an unusually fiery attack on the Department of Mineral Resources, exposing rifts in the sector.Apart from reiterating Wednesday&rsquo;s criticism that the process used by the department to come up with the third version of the charter was "seriously flawed", Baxter said the document, which will extend the racial transformation and ownership of the mining industry begun with the 2004 and then 2010 charters, would damage the sector."The cumulative effect of all the [department&rsquo;s] proposals, combined with existing corporate taxes and royalties, skills development levies and more would materially affect the viability of an industry already in crisis," Baxter said on Wednesday, pointing out South African mining companies made a loss of R37bn in 2015.The department's deputy director-general for mineral policy and promotion, Mosa Mabuza, said on Wednesday the final version of the charter was "materially different" from the original draft and took into account submissions made. Final consultations were taking place with communities and traditional authorities, he said.In total 60 substantive submissions were received and Mabuza said changes had been made to the procurement and community development provisions of the draft.The chamber said comments from Mabuza that the department and chamber were having fruitful talks around the contentious issue of ownership and that the chamber could withdraw its court process were not a "fair reflection of where we are". The chamber is seeking a declaratory order to find clarity around the interpretation of the first two versions of the charter on the continuing consequences of black ownership deals that no longer exist."That declaratory order process is not closed. It hasn't been stopped or cancelled but held in abeyance while we continue this negotiation process. We live in hope of continuing negotiations until the department makes it abundantly clear that they have no further intention of talking to us further on this process," said Tebello Chabana, the chamber's senior executive in charge of public affairs and transformation.The court case could be restarted at any time, but a number of CEOs, including Anglo American&rsquo;s Mark Cutifani, and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane have said they would prefer the question of ownership to be settled through talks rather than in court, a view not widely shared in the industry.Since a meeting in July and a submission from the chamber to the department in September, there had been no further movement on the matter, Chabana said.Baxter tore into the department for its lack of support for the industry during what has been a tough number of years.Local mining companies have grappled with volatile and low commodity prices since the onset of the global financial crisis, soaring input costs of electricity and other government-provided services, a fractious workforce, and a damaging and uncertain regulatory environment, with critical legislation stuck in a political quagmire since 2012."The chamber notes that despite the serious viability crisis currently being faced by the South African mining sector, the [department] has not offered or displayed any interest in assisting the industry through this crisis," Baxter said.The department had actively worked to prevent the industry from restructuring to cope with the tough financial situation it found itself in, Baxter said, pointing to a joint process involving companies, unions and the department to save jobs amid a slew of job cuts in recent years.Employment in the mining sector fell to 462,000 in 2015 from 496,000 and 510,000 in 2014 and 2013, respectively."The [department] has not pursued the other measures explored, such as reducing cost pressures or developing the markets," Baxter said.DA mineral resources spokesman James Lorimer commented that the charter "will force miners to comply with a morass of new regulations, which will up their costs and risks". This would mean lower industry growth and less job creation.
