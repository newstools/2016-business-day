Prosecutions head Shaun Abrahams has delivered written representations to President Jacob Zuma on why he should not be suspended pending an inquiry into whether he is fit for office. On November 14, Zuma gave Abrahams until Monday to make submissions. He made the same request of the two senior prosecutors who took the original decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan: acting head of the priority crimes litigation unit Torie Pretorius and Gauteng director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi. The Presidency said on Monday "the matter was being attended to". The DA has in the meantime called on Zuma to make Abrahams’s submission public. MP Glynnis Breytenbach said the public deserved to know the facts surrounding the Gordhan matter. "It is therefore of national importance that the president handles the rest of the process with complete transparency, in doing so placing himself above suspicion," she said. In terms of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, the president may remove Abrahams only after an inquiry into whether he is fit for office, a removal that Parliament can veto. The legislation also gives the president the power provisionally to suspend him pending the inquiry. Last week, a court case seeking to force Zuma’s hand on the suspensions and to establish an inquiry was struck off the roll because it was not urgent.
