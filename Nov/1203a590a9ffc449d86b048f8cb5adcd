Florence &mdash; A shell-shocked Allister Coetzee believes he still has the backing of his players after the Springboks slumped to a 20-18 defeat against Italy on Saturday.It was the Boks&rsquo; seventh loss in 11 Tests in 2016 and also the first time Italy have beaten the Springboks in 13 attempts.The defeat comes in a season when the Boks lost at home to Ireland for the first time&sbquo; away to Argentina for a first time and endured a record 57-15 home defeat against the All Blacks.It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what more Coetzee could do to force SA Rugby to cut their losses&sbquo; but the mother body issued a hasty statement after the match explaining a full review would take place after next week&rsquo;s Test against Wales.But that is standard procedure. It&rsquo;s almost unprecedented for SA Rugby to make such a statement and the fact that it didn&rsquo;t unequivocally back the coach and his staff&sbquo; was telling.Coetzee&sbquo; when asked directly if he would resign&sbquo; was evasive."My future is out of my hands but this was definitely not Springbok standard&sbquo;" Coetzee said."This is the darkest and toughest moment of my coaching career. But I don&rsquo;t want to look at it emotionally now because emotions are high. I&rsquo;m in a difficult position. It&rsquo;s not easy."I still think I&rsquo;m the man that can turn it around and I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve lost the changeroom."We have a plan and players bought into it. But somehow when the pressure was on and Italy stayed close and got belief&sbquo; we [the players] went outside the plan again. The plan is always there. There is never a moment when I could say the players put in the work."Italy coach Conor O&rsquo;Shea backed Coetzee to stay in the job."I feel massively for Allister tonight because he is an incredible man and coach and I hope people in SA stick by him&sbquo;" O&rsquo;Shea said.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
