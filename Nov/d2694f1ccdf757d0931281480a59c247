There comes a point when confusion turns into exasperation and exasperation becomes confusion. President Jacob Zuma gave notice on Tuesday of his intention to suspend Shaun Abrahams, the national director of public prosecutions, and two other officials pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.The ostensible motivation is rooted in the concerns raised by the Helen Suzman Foundation about the manner in which the National Prosecuting Authority conducted the attempted prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.What is one to make of this decision? Given the botched attempted prosecution, it&rsquo;s possible to understand this as payback for poor performance. The rap over the knuckles may be a consequence not of the decision to prosecute Gordhan, but the failure to prosecute him effectively.Which is it?Some insight into this question was provided on Tuesday when legal submissions in the case revealed that behind the scenes, there had been a fearsome row between Abrahams and the head of the Hawks, Berning Ntlemeza, over the prosecution &mdash; or the lack thereof.Letters between the heads of the two institutions show that Ntlemeza was furious at Abrahams&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the charges, while Abrahams responded equally furiously that the Hawks had never made him aware of the so-called Symington affidavit. This document demonstrated that Gordhan had in fact obtained legal advice on granting early retirement to Ivan Pillay, deputy head of the South African Revenue Service.Had the Symington affidavit formed part of their deliberations, prosecutors would have found it impossible to demonstrate that Gordhan had acted with fraudulent intent.Effectively, Abrahams is accusing the Hawks of handing him a defective investigation.Leaving the particulars of the case aside for a moment, two things are painfully obvious. First, the state of the investigation and prosecution of serious cases and the motives that inform them, already frighteningly parlous, is going from bad to worse.Second, the blame for this situation lies squarely in the province of Zuma himself. Zuma&rsquo;s constant fear of his own prosecution has skewered the justice system, and the public of SA is getting beyond exasperated.Last week, there was another parliamentary motion of no confidence in the president, something that has become a regular feature on the parliamentary programme since Zuma began his second term of office in 2014 and the multiple scandals around him have emerged.These no-confidence motions are usually accompanied by considerable sound and fury as Zuma loyalists in the ANC benches use multiple points of order to defend him against opposition insults. Opposition parties have argued that the ANC should not be defending a man who has betrayed his oath of office and contravened the Constitution.Mostly, these motions were an exercise in futility as the juggernaut that is the ANC majority easily defeated them. But last week&rsquo;s, led by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, was significantly different. This time, it was set in a dramatically changed political geography around Zuma.The "exercise in futility" criticism of the effort has begun to fade because there is political capital to be made through these no-confidence debates as the ANC protects someone who is fast becoming a failed president.The 2019 general election, as the ANC is uncomfortably aware, is just around the next corner. So the question is: can the ANC afford the collateral damage that comes with allowing Zuma to serve his full term until 2019, when every time they defend him, it just gets worse?
