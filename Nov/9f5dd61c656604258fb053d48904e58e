Absa Bank acted in good faith when in 2013 it closed down the bank accounts of businessman Fana Hlongwane and his companies, the High Court in Pretoria said on Thursday.The judgment comes in the wake of the court application by the Treasury, asking for a declaration that it may not intervene in the relationship between the big four banks and the Gupta family, after their bank accounts were closed by all four banks.In response to the litigation, the Guptas have asked the Treasury and the banks for documents that would shed more light on why they closed the accounts. It is understood there is some debate over what information and documents the Guptas are entitled to, if any.The judgment on Thursday revealed that Hlongwane had sought more information on the closure of his Absa accounts but, unlike the Guptas, his request was made under the Promotion of Access to Information Act.Judge Nomonde Mngqibisa-Thusi said the applicants &mdash; Hlongwane and his companies &mdash; asked for the information because they were considering their legal options, believing the closure of the accounts was unfair and a breach of their constitutional rights.Mngqibisa-Thusi said Absa had given the applicants some of the requested documents and reasons for its decision. In 2012, the Arms Procurement Commission requested information about "some of the applicants".The commission, chaired by Supreme Court of Appeal Justice Willie Seriti, was established to investigate allegations of corruption and irregularities in the arms deal.Hlongwane was implicated in the commission s investigations, which made him "a high-risk client", said the judge.Absa was entitled, in terms of their contractual relationship, to terminate on reasonable notice. It had "no obligation" to retain clients whose monitoring in terms of money laundering measures would be more onerous compared with the benefit in retaining them.In April, the Seriti commission found that there was nothing untoward in the arms deal.Mngqibisa-Thusi said the applicants in this case had nowhere said which of their rights they sought to protect, as required by the act. This indicated they "might have been on a fishing expedition to find out circuitously what information the commission had on them"."I am of the view that [Absa s] bona fides in deciding to close the applicants accounts cannot be questioned," she said.Hlongwane could not be reached for comment. An Absa spokesman said the bank was delighted with the judgment as it confirmed that the bank had acted "correctly and legally".
