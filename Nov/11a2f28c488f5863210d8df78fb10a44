London — British luxury brand Burberry is cutting 15%-20% of its product lines, aiming to focus on its newest ranges as it battles to attract shoppers in a volatile luxury goods market. The company reported a 24% drop in first-half underlying profit on Wednesday, in line with expectations. Luxury brands have been struggling with slowing growth in Asia, a drop in tourist spending in Europe following a series of deadly attacks, and competition from fast-fashion chains. Burberry said in February it would move away from the traditional model of presenting seasonal ranges months ahead of their appearance in store, in favour of two collections a year that would be available in shops immediately. Finance chief Carol Fairweather said the company was cutting back on product lines ahead of the Christmas trading period and would give greater prominence to its newest products, such as the bridle bag that was a top seller from its September runway show. "We are delighted with everything we have in place for [the] festive [season]" she said. Burberry reported adjusted pretax profit of £146m, reflecting tougher trading in stores in the US and Hong Kong. The company had already announced a 4% drop in half-year sales to £1.16bn in October as weak demand in some overseas markets offset a surge in sales in its British home as tourists took advantage of a lower pound. Shares in Burberry, along with other luxury groups such as LVMH, fell on Wednesday after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election added to uncertainty over prospects for the global economy, analysts said. Burberry makes about 20% of its sales in the US. Citi analysts said they expected no change to forecasts for Burberry to make full-year adjusted pretax profit of £447m, but added the US election and exchange rate volatility could knock consumer confidence and global luxury demand.
