The rand was slightly firmer in lacklustre trade at midday on Thursday, as the market awaited a rate decision by the South African Reserve Bank in the afternoon."With the US closed for Thanksgiving today, the focus will be on our local monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, where a rate change is highly unlikely even though inflation printed 6.4% for October, higher than what most were expecting," said TreasuryOne head of currency dealing Wichard Cilliers.At 11.31am the rand was at R14.1368 to the dollar from a previous R14.1547.The local currency was at R14.9359 against the euro from R14.9343 and at R17.5794 against the British pound from R17.6138.The euro was at $1.0566 from $1.0550.The MPC was likely to point out the effect of the weaker rand on its interest rates decision. Future projections may indicate the inflationary consequences, which could warrant a more hawkish stance in 2017.No change was expected on the day. "The Reserve Bank was unlikely to raise rates in the near term, and may indicate that we are close to, if not at, the peak of the current interest rate cycle," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said.Just a little more than two weeks ago, the rand exchanged hands at about R13.21 to the dollar before retreating to current levels of about R14.20. It weakened to about R14.50 to the dollar after Donald Trump&rsquo;s unexpected election victory in the US.The weaker rand poses a danger to inflation, which quickened to an annual rate of 6.4% in October, from 6.1% in September, according to Statistics SA data.
