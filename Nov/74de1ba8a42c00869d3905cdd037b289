AngloGold Ashanti lowered its net debt below $2bn for the first time since early 2012 as a higher gold price during its September quarter offset lower production and contributed to strong cash flows. AngloGold, the world’s third-largest gold miner by volume, has, however, reined in its full-year production guidance to the lower end of its earlier targets because of lower grades and safety stoppages in SA, where it has already lost 82,800oz of gold so far this year. Looking ahead, AngloGold forecast its full-year production at between 3.6-million and 3.65-million ounces compared to an earlier forecast of between 3.6-million and 3.8-million ounces. The all-in sustaining costs forecast ballooned to between $980/oz and $1,010/oz from an earlier range of $900/oz to $960/oz. "While we see this as negative for sentiment, it should still be noted that the company has delivered $239m of free cash flow in the year to date," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Hatch, pointing out that last year AngloGold had generated $19m in free cash. The full-year forecast implied production of about 960,000oz, which would be achieved by a strong performance at the new Kibali mine AngloGold shares with Randgold Resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo. AngloGold’s free cash flow for the three months to September was $161m versus $50m paid out during the same period a year earlier and the $108m generated in the first half of the year. Net debt fell to $1.972bn compared to $2.098bn in the June quarter and the first time since the second quarter of 2012 it is below the $2bn mark. During the quarter, AngloGold lost 38,600oz of gold to safety stoppages at its South African mines, bringing the total for the year to more than 82,800oz. AngloGold CEO Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said while his officials were "still in constructive dialogue" with their opposite numbers at the department, the company had taken a more "prudent" outlook of what its South African mines would deliver next year. But, he added, it would not be less than this year. At the suspended Obuasi mine in Ghana, where the government has finally ordered security forces to remove 12,000 illegal miners from the property after almost 10 months of inaction, there were now up to 2,000 people left. AngloGold was waiting for the state’s all-clear before assessing damage to surface and underground infrastructure, Venkatakrishnan said.
