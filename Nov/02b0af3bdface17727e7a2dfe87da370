The rand continued to strengthen against all major currencies at midday on Tuesday as markets began to regain some composure after the panic caused by Donald Trump’s shock victory in the US presidential election. The rand was 2% stronger against the dollar from Monday’s levels. RMB Global Market Research macroeconomist Isaah Mhlanga said the rand, which had been weaker against the dollar, had moved to a more neutral position, and was expected to be firmer against the dollar by the end of the week. He said the local currency was still in murky water as the two big drivers of rand weakness were performing at dangerously high levels. The two drivers were the two-year US treasury yields, which had spiked above 1% on four separate occasions on Monday, and the dollar index, which was at an 11-month high, Mhlanga said. Standard Bank’s executive head of foreign exchange spot trading, Warrick Butler, said the market took a "bit of a breather" on Monday afternoon. "I think the panic that the Trump victory has caused may have been overdone, especially when one considers that [Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet] Yellen is still in charge of the Fed for just over a year, and people are starting to see some real value at current levels," said Butler. He said that the Fed was more likely to allow the US to run a high-pressure economy and let things become overheated before reacting with the policy mechanisms. European GDP and US retail sales data due for release on Tuesday could cause some volatility in the market, but event risk remained low, Butler said. At 11:30am‚ the rand was at R14.1405 to the dollar from Monday’s R14.4356. It was at R15.2800 to the euro from R15.4991 and R17.5708 to the pound from R18.0363 The euro was at $1.0803‚ from $1.0739.
