Adelaide &mdash; Usman Khawaja hit his country&rsquo;s first century of the series to help Australia to 209/3 at dinner on the second day of the day-night third Test against SA on Friday, a first-innings deficit of just 50 runs.The left-hander, who opened in place of David Warner after SA&rsquo;s declaration on 259/9 on Thursday, shared a partnership of 137 with Steve Smith after Kyle Abbott had taken two wickets in the first hour of the day.The partnership ended in a calamitous run-out for the Australia skipper half an hour before the break but Khawaja brushed off the disappointment to reach the milestone for the fifth time in Tests with a 10th four cut through point.The 29-year-old will resume for the night session unbeaten on 108 alongside Peter Handscomb, who had made 14 not out.Smith, who made 59, will certainly rue testing the arm of Vernon Philander at point by setting off for an optimistic single, which resulted in him standing stranded in the middle of the pitch as Quinton de Kock removed the bails.Without that miscommunication, Australia might have batted through the session and taken a firm grip on a match which they must not lose to avoid a first ever 3-0 series sweep on home soil.Handscomb is one of three new caps in the team and another, Matt Renshaw, was one of two early victims for the standout South African bowler Abbott, who came into the side in the second Test for the injured Dale Steyn.Bowling with great discipline, Abbott took 2/7 with six maidens in his first 10-over spell.Australia resumed on 14/0 but Renshaw was able to add only two runs to his overnight tally before he was brilliantly caught for 10 at third slip by Dean Elgar.The umpires checked to ensure Elgar had kept the ball off the grass with boos ringing around Adelaide Oval when it was confirmed by the third official that he had.That brought to the crease Warner, who was unable to open as usual on Thursday after Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis s calculated declaration caught him off the field having treatment on his shoulder.Warner had scored just 11 runs when he got an edge off an Abbott delivery that was seaming away from him, with Elgar once again snaffling the catch in the cordon.With debutants Handscomb and Nic Maddinson next in the batting order, it was vital that Khawaja and Smith held firm to prevent another of the batting collapses that helped SA to victories in Perth and Hobart.Reuters
