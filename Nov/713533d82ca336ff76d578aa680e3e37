At a stakeholder workshop earlier in November on the proposed tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, the Treasury said it was proceeding with plans to implement the tax on April 1 2017, and that legislative measures, including the introduction of a new schedule to the Customs and Excise Act, would be finalised in early 2017.The Treasury said it still favoured the approach of taxing each gram of sugar in a beverage at an initial rate of 2.29c per gram, with the intention of increasing that rate annually by at least inflation.This equates to an approximate tax burden of 20% on the average price per litre of sugar-sweetened beverages.In its policy paper published in July, the Treasury differentiated between naturally occurring sugars &mdash; intrinsic sugar &mdash; found in the structure of most foods such as fruits, vegetables and dairy products which would be exempt from tax; and sugar added to the drinks during processing &mdash; free sugars &mdash; which would be subject to the tax. This meant that 100% fruit juice and unsweetened milk products would be exempt from the tax.The Treasury now says it had been a "mistake" to exclude intrinsic sugar from the tax, and announced that 100% fruit juice would be taxed the same as any other sugar-sweetened beverage, although unsweetened milk products would remain exempt unless sugar has been added to them. The Treasury has also extended the tax to include drink mix sold in powder form.The Treasury insisted that the aim of the tax was the prevention of obesity and other related noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, and the measure was not a "stealth tax" to raise revenue.It explained the revenue generated would be used to make funding available on budget to the Department of Health for noncommunicable disease intervention programmes.However, the Treasury would not consider ring-fencing or earmarking the funds generated from the tax for use by a dedicated fund to fight these diseases (similar to the Road Accident Fund) or for exclusive use by the Department of Health.The Treasury said it was "confident" the tax would be introduced as a levy and not an excise duty, which means only SA will benefit from the revenue, and it will not form part of the Southern African Customs Union revenue sharing pool.Attendees at the workshop raised concerns about how the tax would disproportionately affect lower income groups, and the possibly dire economic effect it would have on the formal sector of the economy and the informal sector.Prof Nicola Theron, of Stellenbosch University and MD of Econex, presented the cost-to-benefit of the tax. The three organisations which had modelled the tax effect &mdash; Oxford Economics, Econex and KPMG &mdash; reported similar figures regarding the loss of jobs, effect on the fiscus and reduction in GDP that would result from introducing the tax.KPMG&rsquo;s analysis was independent and not commissioned by any industry player. They forecasted loss of jobs ranges of 41,700-72,000, which includes upstream and downstream job loss, with direct job losses estimated at 28,000-44,000.The total net job loss (after accounting for switching into other spend categories and sectors of employment) will be more than 41,000.The forecast tax revenue that will be lost to the fiscus (from income tax, corporate tax and value added tax) ranges from R2.7bn to R3.2bn, and the forecast reduction in GDP from R10bn to R14.6bn, with the net reduction in GDP at more than R3bn. Theron said while she could not speculate on the effect on the informal sector, as the data available is not as comprehensive as that for the formal sector, by all estimates the effect of the tax will be "fairly large".Given these costs, she said the government had to be certain about the positive health outcomes before imposing the tax, which is a drastic measure.As many participants pointed out at the workshop, no study has been undertaken by the government on nutrition and diet, so the health benefits of the tax are far from certain.The Treasury and other proponents of the tax dismissed the risks of the economic effect, claiming that the initial negative macro-economic effect would be relatively marginal.Treasury officials said the subject is open for discussion and proposals are welcome.&bull; Subban is a partner at Bowmans specialising in customs, excise and international trade, Sher and Li are candidate attorneys at the law firm.&nbsp;
