"Excessive" litigation against Competition Tribunal decisions regarding cartel behaviour require that the rights of appeal be restricted, Competition Commission commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele says. He noted in a briefing to Parliament’s economic development committee on Tuesday that almost all the decisions of the tribunal where the commission had been successful in its action against cartels had been taken on appeal. The commission had submitted a total of 49 cartel cases to the tribunal by the end of September, an indication that more resources and new ways of resolving cases were required. Bonakele noted that there had been an increase in the number of complaints about abuse of dominance last year, mostly in the food and beverage sector followed by the retail/wholesale and construction sectors. There were a number of challenges facing the commission in the enforcement of the law prohibiting abuse of dominance Bonakele said. Proposals to deal with these issues were under discussion with the Department of Economic Development. One of the challenges in dealing with excessive prices related to the calculation of economic value. An example of this was the decision by the Competition Appeal Court to overturn the tribunal’s judgement against Sasol for excessive pricing. In cases of predatory pricing there was a challenge relating to the definition of average variable costs and marginal costs. There had been a move away from a strict definition to a more appropriate measure, which is the average total costs and average avoidable costs. A key challenge with regards to the application of provisions prohibiting price discrimination — aimed primarily at protecting small businesses — was the requirement of proof of the equivalence of the transactions between different purchasers, who had different economics of scale.
