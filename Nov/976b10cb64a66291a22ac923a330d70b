Shareholders in Distribution and Warehousing Network (Dawn) must be pondering whether the appointment of industrialist Stephen Connelly as acting CEO came too late to salvage value at the company.Dawn issued a depressing trading statement on Monday, warning of a headline loss of between 125c and 145c per share for the six months to the end of September.The company has seen one-off asset write-downs and impairments in a number of businesses &ndash; "necessitated by the current economic environment, as well as the poor performance of certain Dawn businesses", the statement said.The Dawn trading statement was not exactly well-timed because another industrial stalwart, Invicta Holdings, emerged from its interim period in relatively fine fettle.But what will irk shareholders most is that the effect of these losses has obliterated Dawn&rsquo;s net asset value. NAV is now estimated at 66% and 68% lower at between 265c to 285c per share &ndash; an ominous reduction from the 826c per share reported at the end of September last year.NAV was already more than 40% lower at 440c per share at the end of the financial year in March this year. This means the tangible value in Dawn has dropped by another 35% in just six months.Clearly, previous management have made an awful mess of things, and poor Connelly, former CEO of Hudaco, must feel like he has been parachuted into the twilight zone. Still, if there is one executive that can repair Dawn, it is Connelly. Just don&rsquo;t expect a quick fix.In what is becoming a hallmark of the Jacob Zuma presidency and his government, the courts have to show it how to behave.The latest example is the judgment handed down by the Labour Court earlier this month when AngloGold Ashanti followed its rights and contested the closure by inspectors at the Department of Mineral Resources of its entire Kopanang mine near Orkney for safety infringements in a small section of the underground workings.The department&rsquo;s safety stoppages ordered in terms of the Mine Health and Safety Act have become a major source of friction in the industry.Every CEO concedes the point that more must be done to make their operations safer and there should be consequences for violating safety rules, but the key word in their discussion is "proportionality".&nbsp;Judge Andre van Niekerk found that proportionality in the safety stoppage was completely lacking, likening it to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. He ordered the mine reopened, bar the offending area.Shutting down an entire mine such as Kopanang at a cost of R9.5m a day for infringements in a small area is driving many mining companies to speak out.The Chamber of Mines estimates that between 2012 and 2015, miners have lost more than R13bn in revenue to closures, and this figure does not take into account lost production during the ramp-up to return mines to a steady state, or the wages paid and other costs while the mines are idled.The department&rsquo;s dedication to safety is admirable, but a slightly lighter hand on the reins could resolve one of the areas of distrust and friction between companies and the department.&bull; Neels Blom edits Company Comment (blomn@bdlive.co.za)
