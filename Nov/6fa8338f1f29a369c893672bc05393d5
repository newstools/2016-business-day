Salaried employees in SA typically get R10,061 in their bank accounts every month. After taking inflation into account, they are poorer than three years ago, the BankservAfrica Disposable Salary Index for October, released on Thursday, showed. While the most common – what statisticians call the mode – take home pay was R10,061, the average for October came to R13,413. This was 3.5% higher than the R12,954 in October 2015, without taking inflation into account. After accounting for inflation, average take home pay was 2.6% lower than a year ago. Average salaries have not kept pace with inflation for three years, according to the index. "This is the longest period of decline on BankservAfrica’s records for real disposable salaries data," BankservAfrica head of knowledge and risk services Caroline Belrose said. The survey found the most common pay band, accounting for 39.5% of South African employees, was between R10,000 and R25,000 after tax and other deductions. The next most common band was R4,000 to R10,000, which accounted for 32%, while 17.7% earned less than R4,000 a month. Nine percent of South Africans earn between R25,000 and R50,000 a month, and 1.9% over R50,000 a month.
