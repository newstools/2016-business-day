President Jacob Zuma has survived an attempt to remove him from office after a dramatic three-day ANC national executive committee meeting.The ANC will announce the outcome of the meeting at a media briefing on Tuesday, after Zuma&rsquo;s departure for Havana, for the funeral of former Cuban president Fidel Castro.Sources in the NEC said on Tuesday that the motion to remove Zuma was rejected and a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; was reached.The ANC NEC was divided on Zuma&rsquo;s future, with both his detractors and supporters pushing to win the day, after his recall as president was raised at the meeting on Saturday.In an unprecedented debate, which most analysts see as the waning of Zuma&rsquo;s political clout, some members called for him to step down and those close to him came to his defence.The NEC meeting was supposed to have ended on Sunday but was extended to yesterday as both sides failed to agree on a way forward for the president.During the meeting, the stalemate prompted ANC Northern Cape secretary Zemani Saul to propose a compromise.He suggested that the top six leaders of the party should wrangle over the issue and report back to the NEC and for the discussion to be taken to a consultative conference to take place next year.The ANC will announce whether this is the course of action it will take at its media briefing at 2pm.
