Dubai &mdash; Deutsche Bank expects mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) to pick up in the Middle East and Africa in 2017 after a "subdued" 2016, says the head of the company in the region, Jamal al-Kishi.Deals and initial public offerings would add to accelerating debt sales as governments seek to fill budget gaps caused by the oil slump, Kishi said.Rising borrowing costs and slower growth would encourage private sector consolidation and fundraising, he said.Kishi said 2017 "looks promising and there is a healthy pipeline of debt capital markets deals, mergers and acquisitions, and even some initial public offerings". By contrast, 2016 has "been a fairly subdued year for the investment banks in the region", he added.Bond sales in the region have been among the bright spots for securities firms and Deutsche Bank in particular, as initial public offerings (IPOs) and deals have been declining. The lender&rsquo;s market share for bond and Sukuk sales in the Middle East and Africa has increased even as the investment bank slid in its home territory.IPOs in the Middle East and Africa are on track for the lowest value in at least three years, with just $5.3bn raised in 2016. The value of completed deals has dropped 48% from 2015.Bond sales have benefited as energy exporters from Qatar to Abu Dhabi seek to buttress their finances. Debt sales in the Middle East and North Africa reached $73bn in 2016, the most since Bloomberg began compiling data in 2005. Deutsche Bank was one of the bookrunners on Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s debut $17.5bn bond in October, the biggest emerging-market issue in 2016.The bank is ranked seventh for debt sales from the Middle East and Africa, rising eight places from 2015.Clients in the region continue to have "esteem and affection" for Deutsche Bank and have an "unwavering desire to grow their long-standing partnerships with us", Kishi said.The success of the Saudi bond deal it drew $67bn in offers will help encourage more companies and financial institutions to sell bonds in the coming year, he said.Lower valuations as a result of slower economic growth in the region will also help drive M&amp;A, Kishi said.Government ReformsThe slump in crude prices is forcing spending cuts, privatisations and consolidation among state-owned firms."Looking across M&amp;A, debt capital markets, IPOs, hedging and financing transactions, the pipeline is looking fairly robust going into the new year," Kishi said."Government reforms, privatisations and the decline in oil prices are all driving that, coupled with the fact that liquidity from the international community is in decline."Bloomberg
