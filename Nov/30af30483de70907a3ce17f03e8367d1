The rand was on the defensive on Thursday morning, having failed to crack the R14/$ barrier due to renewed strength in the dollar after another round of upbeat US data. The data out on Wednesday included better than expected durable goods orders for October, which bolstered chances of an interest rate increase in December. The dollar has steadily gathered momentum since Donald Trump won the US presidential race amid the hope increased fiscal spending will boost inflation, leading to more rate increases. The interest in the greenback has knocked the rand, although the latter has slowly clawed back some of its recent losses. The rand’s vulnerability to global market swings is likely to feature when the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee delivers its decision on in interest rates. Just a little more than two weeks ago, the rand exchanged hands at about R13.21 to the dollar before retreating to current levels around R14.21. The weaker rand poses a danger to inflation, which quickened to an annual rate of 6.4% in October, from 6.1% in September, according to Statistics SA data. At 9.36am, the rand was at R14.2118 to the dollar from Wednesday’s R14.1547. It was at R14.9623 to the euro from R14.9342 and R17.6578 to the pound from R17.6138 The euro was at $1.0529, from $1.0550.
