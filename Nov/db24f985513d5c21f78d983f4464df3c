Businessman and ANC stalwart Sipho Pityana on Wednesday referred to President Jacob Zuma "my dear Number 783". This is the number of corruption charges he faced‚ which were dropped in 2009. In April this year‚ state prosecutors said they needed time to study the High Court’s ruling after it ordered that the decision to drop the charges should be reviewed. The court held that the decision of April 1 2009‚ taken by the acting national director of public prosecutions at the time, Mokotedi Mpshe, to drop 783 arms deal-related charges against Zuma‚ was irrational and should be reviewed and set aside. Mpshe dropped the charges because he believed Scorpions boss Leonard McCarthy had manipulated the timing of when to serve the indictment against Zuma. The NPA’s decision to drop corruption charges against Zuma was based largely on what have become known as the "spy tapes". In these conversations‚ former NPA boss Bulelani Ngcuka and McCarthy discussed whether then president Thabo Mbeki’s prospects to be re-elected as ANC president would be strengthened if the indictment against Zuma were to be served before‚ during or after the ANC’s elective conference in Polokwane in December 2007. Zuma‚ who was elected ANC president at that conference‚ was eventually charged after the conference, on December 28 2007. The court’s ruling this year did not automatically reinstate the charges against Zuma. A legal process involving state prosecuting authorities and the courts must reach a decision on whether to charge him. TMG Digital
