The South African bond market was firmer at midday on Monday as the market continued to react positively to the reprieve from ratings agencies at the weekend. Fitch lowered its outlook on SA to negative, but the ratings remained unchanged for both Fitch and Moody’s. The market showed little apprehension about S&P’s rating announcement due on Friday though some analysts predicted that S&P could downgrade SA to junk or subinvestment status. At 11.37pm the R186 was bid at 8.86% from 9.065% and the R207 was bid at 8.11% from 8.295%. The stronger rand provided support to bonds, with the rand gaining 1.29% to R13.8535 against the dollar from R14.0350. The positive sentiment in the bond market was based on the view that an eventual downgrade would not have much of an effect economically. "A move into junk status would have serious political ramifications, but the economic and financial impact of a downgrade wouldn’t be as significant," said Capital Economics analyst John Ashbourne. The bond market was keeping an eye on the ANC national executive committee meeting debating a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Ashbourne said that if there was a downgrade, critics would probably blame the embattled president, whose corruption scandals had sapped investor confidence. "Fitch explicitly cited infighting within the ruling ANC as one of the reasons for its negative outlook," Ashbourne said The weaker dollar resulted in US treasury yields firming with the 10-year treasury at 2.3267% from 2.3581%.
