Inputs from Cabinet and government departments have been incorporated into an amended integrated energy plan, which will differ from the draft submitted to Cabinet by Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson.This is according to Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, who was speaking at a post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday.Radebe was questioned about the delay in releasing the plan, which was adopted by the Cabinet, with amendment, two weeks ago.The plan will lay the basis for the government&rsquo;s energy planning, and contains the future projections for electricity demand and supply.Radebe said the plan to be released to the public by Joemat-Pettersson was not the same document presented to Cabinet because of discussions within Cabinet and because of the inputs of different departments within Cabinet.
