Impala Platinum subsidiary Zimplats will invest $264m in Zimbabwe to develop a new underground mine to replace two depleted mines in that country.Zimbabwe, which has the second-largest known platinum deposits after SA, is a difficult place to make investment decisions, with the cash-strapped government placing numerous demands on the company and forcing through policies that damage investor confidence.Zimplats, a Sydney-listed company that is 87% owned by SA&rsquo;s Implats, opted to make the investment after the completion of a bankable feasibility study into the new 25-year Mupani mine that will keep output from Zimbabwe at a steady 260,000oz of platinum and 220,000oz of palladium a year, replacing the Rukodzi and Ngwarati mines.The internally funded 2.2-million tonnes a year mine will add 3-million ounces of platinum to Zimplats&rsquo;s 6-million ounces of reserves and it will reach steady state production by 2025 after the first mining teams are sent underground in January 2021.Zimplats started early-stage work in June this year and has completed the box cut for the portal leading into the mechanised underground mine."This investment is an important development for Zimbabwe and will provide much-needed support to the local economy at an extremely difficult time, reinforcing our commitment to sustain and grow our investments in the country," Zimplats CEO Alex Mhembere said on Wednesday."While this project was commissioned against the backdrop of depressed metal prices, the estimated capital investment of some $264m will be deployed over the next nine years, with much of the underground development work being done on-reef and the required capital expenditure financed through Zimplats&rsquo;s own internal resources," he said.By doing development on reef means Zimplats will generate revenue from the investment phase by processing metal from extracted reef and it can plough that money back into the project, easing pressure on its balance sheet."This significantly decreases the capital intensity and peak funding requirements of the project, while ensuring that Zimplats is perfectly positioned to capitalise on the anticipated turnaround in the PGM market and stronger metal prices in the future," Mhembere said.Implats CEO Terence Goodlace said the Mupani investment would underpin Zimplats&rsquo;s beneficiation strategy in Zimbabwe, which is pushing platinum mining companies hard to produce a finished metal rather than sending material to plants in SA for final processing."Zimplats has invested $23m to date in advancing a base metal processing facility in Zimbabwe whose pace of development is being matched to the availability of cash resources as a result of current low commodity prices," Goodlace said.
