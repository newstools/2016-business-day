New York &mdash; US cigarette maker Reynolds American is trying to get a higher price from British American Tobacco after rejecting its $47bn takeover offer, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.BAT, which owns 42% of Reynolds American, offered last month to buy the remaining shares of the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes to create the world&rsquo;s biggest listed tobacco company."We thought it was a possibility, so it&rsquo;s not too surprising," said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. "Depending on how another offer from BAT could be structured, there&rsquo;s a bit of a circular argument here for the value of Reynolds," Fleck said.The groups are in talks and BAT is willing to raise its bid slightly, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.Altria controls 51% of the US market and Reynolds 34%. Analysts estimate that with the Reynolds acquisition the US would account for about 40% of BAT sales and 50% of its profits.BAT&rsquo;s cash-and-stock offer would mark the return of the group to the lucrative, highly regulated US market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in the US and international markets.Some analysts say the deal could encourage current market leader Philip Morris International to reunite with its US affiliate Altria, reversing a 2008 spin-off of the international business.Reynolds American and BAT declined to comment.Reynolds American&rsquo;s market capitalisation was about $76bn at Monday&rsquo;s close priced at $53.05 a share. The share price had risen nearly 15% this year.Reuters
