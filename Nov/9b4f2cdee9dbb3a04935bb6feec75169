The South African bond market was relatively well supported on Monday morning, with the yield on the benchmark R186 bond creeping back below 9%. The bond market got a fillip from the relatively firmer rand, which strengthened through the R14.40 to the dollar. The dollar, which has been the currency of choice over the past two weeks because of the expectation of a US rate hike, paused on Monday morning in line with US government bond yields. The yield on the US 10-year treasury note slipped to 2.3137% from 2.3548%. The yield on the local R186 was at 8.950% from 8.960%. Meanwhile, foreign investors sold a net R3.13bn worth of local bonds last week, according to the JSE data.
