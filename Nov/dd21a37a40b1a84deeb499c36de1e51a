London-listed Randgold Resources and Australia&rsquo;s Newcrest Mining have teamed up to explore for fresh gold deposits in the Ivory Coast where the two companies have a presence, marking an increased collaboration by gold miners seeking new mines.Randgold, headed by Mark Bristow, is proud of its mine development track record in West Africa and more recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is finishing the construction of the Kibali gold mine with AngloGold Ashanti.Newcrest, Australia&rsquo;s largest gold producer, is in a joint venture at the Wafi-Golpu copper and gold prospect with Harmony Gold in Papua New Guinea. Harmony recently bought Newcrest&rsquo;s stake in the Hidden Valley gold and silver mine.A number of CEs, including Gold Fields&rsquo; Nick Holland and Bristow, have spoken of the global depletion of known gold deposits and the dearth of new large discoveries.While some companies are targeting existing mines to bolster reserves &mdash; Harmony is looking for at least 100,000oz of gold production in Africa to replace ageing and depleted gold mines in SA &mdash; others are looking for fresher targets."Our preferred growth model is capture of early-stage opportunities, as well as greenfield and brownfield developments, rather than acquiring producing assets," Newcrest chairman Peter Hay said earlier this month.The heads of agreement between Randgold and Newcrest will create an exploration joint venture to explore for and potentially develop mines in the Ivory Coast.Randgold, which has an aggressive exploration programme in Africa, will manage the exploration and any mine that comes from the work."The bigger the footprint, the greater the opportunity, and Newcrest and Randgold believe in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and the potential for the discovery of world-class gold deposits," Bristow said.
