Dubai — Emirates Group first-half profit plunged 64% as the world’s biggest airline by global traffic struggled with a rising US dollar and political and economic uncertainty that damped global travel and weighed on fares. Net income fell to 1.3-billion dirhams ($364m) in the six months to end-September from 3.7-billion dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based carrier said on Wednesday in a statement. Revenue rose 1% to 46.5-billion dirhams. "The bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm, with no immediate resolution in sight," Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said. "We continue to make strategic investments, because we know we have to work even harder for every customer." Emirates, which has exploited its Persian Gulf location to turn its Dubai hub into an intercontinental crossroads, has faced a tough year. Low petroleum prices have sapped demand for lucrative premium bookings from executives in the oil and gas industry, while terrorist attacks in Europe have scared off travellers from Asia. The dollar’s exchange-rate gains held back revenue growth, which Emirates also said was hurt by currency restrictions in some African countries. Cash at the group dwindled to 14.9-billion dirhams by September 30, from 23.5-billion dirhams on March 31 as the company invested in new aircraft, among other payments. Emirates took delivery of eight Airbus Group SE double-decker A380 airliners and eight Boeing 777s, and 20 more wide-bodies will join the fleet by the end of the financial year. Fuel costs fell 10% in the first half amid low oil prices, reducing spending on jet fuel to 24% of operating costs from 28% a year earlier. Bloomberg
