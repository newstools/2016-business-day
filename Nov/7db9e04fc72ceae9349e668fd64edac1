SA&rsquo;s economic activity is likely to have remained subdued, data out this week &mdash; including labour statistics, retail sales and consumer spending &mdash; are bound to show.Local data on the agenda include the Labour Force Survey for the third quarter of 2016, which Statistics SA is due to release on Tuesday.The survey was expected to show the unemployment rate at 26.4% compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter, Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan said.Job creation in the private sector was expected to be weak, in line with stagnant economic activity and depressed business confidence. There was scope for public sector employment to have risen temporarily because of the municipal elections in August, she said.Retail sales data, due for release by Statistics SA on Wednesday, are also expected to remain subdued as consumer confidence and high unemployment take their toll.Growth in retail sales for September was forecast to have risen to 1% year on year from 0.2% year on year in August, remaining below the average year-on-year rate of 2.3% so far in 2016, Kaplan said.The ability and willingness of consumers to spend had been affected by weaker growth in real disposable income, depressed confidence, the muted rate of credit extension to households and higher taxes, she said.On the international front, US October industrial and manufacturing production data are on the radar screen, and jobless claims for November are on the menu on Thursday.The data will provide clues on the possibility of a US interest rate increase in December. The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s federal open market committee will meet on December 13 and 14, with some analysts predicting a 25 basis point increase.The unexpected victory of Republican Donald Trump over Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton has cause concern and uncertainty about future US interest rate increases.Emerging markets, including SA, sold off following Trump&rsquo;s unexpected win as risk aversion roiled global markets, but some calm returned by Friday.The JSE, however, took a beating as concern increased about the possibility of US interest rate increases under Trump, who will assume office in January.Higher US interest rates are bound to support the dollar and will cause emerging market currencies, including the rand, to lose value.Global investors are keenly waiting to see what the fate of Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen will be and what shape US government spending will take under Trump.&nbsp;
