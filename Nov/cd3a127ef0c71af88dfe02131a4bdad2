The lack of load shedding is not good news for everyone. Equipment services specialist enX group announced on Wednesday that it had managed to grow revenue 30% to R1.1bn during the year to end-August. This was despite sales of its backup power systems suffering due to Eskom’s improved reliability. A one-off R78m goodwill impairment for its power division caused the group to fall into a R71m aftertax loss from the previous year’s R21.8m profit. Power segment revenues were up 19% to R370m compared with R455m in 2015 due to a decrease in load shedding during the reporting period. The group’s gross margins reduced to 23% compared with last year as a result of the decline in margins in the power segment. The group completed its acquisition of Eqstra, profitable industrial equipment and logistics operations that operates in SA and sub-Saharan Africa. The group said that it completed three other major transactions that would contribute to transforming the company into an industrial business. The group said it had completed an empowerment deal worth R213m, it also acquired Genmatics, a provider of temporary power solutions based in KwaZulu-Natal. The acquisition increases the group’s generator fleet to more than 250. The group also said that it acquired West Africa International and African Group Lubricants (AGI). This acquisition would boost the company’s market share in the oil lubricants market in SA and add scale to the business Revenue growth for the group came from its petrochemicals segment.
