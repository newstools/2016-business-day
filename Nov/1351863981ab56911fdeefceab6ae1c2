The South African bond market held up at firmer levels on Thursday at midday as the market awaited US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen&rsquo;s speech tonight.Her speech before the Senate Banking Committee is likely to provide further clues as to an expected interest rate hike in the US next month. The market has priced in a 90% possibility of a hike.Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) analyst John Cairns said the market was influenced by Fed member James Bullard&rsquo;s earlier comments on Wednesday that the Fed would hike US interest rates in December barring any major shocks."Yellen&rsquo;s colleague Bullard has stolen some of her thunder, putting it perfectly when he said that only a surprise could halt a December rate increase," Cairns said.According to Cairns, Yellen surely cannot add much more on that issue. "So our focus would be on whether she provides more on what the Fed is thinking about hikes in 2017 in light of the Trump election."The local benchmark R186 bond broke through the 9% threshold on Thursday after US treasury yields firmed on Yellen&rsquo;s expected guidance.At 11.35am the R186 was bid at 8.94% from 9.025% and the R207 was bid at 8.14% from 8.22%.The US 10-year treasury was at 2.1996% from 2.2198%. The UK 10-year gilt was at 1.2576% from 1.2577%.Analysts say the market is likely to remain focused on probable Trump policies going forwardWhatever the rights or wrongs of a political process that has installed Trump as US president, the one thing upon which most market commentators and investors agree is that the economic policies he espouses &ndash; big increases in infrastructure and defence spending, corporate and personal tax cuts and more borrowing &mdash; are bad for the US bond market, said MiltonOptimal analyst Shaun McDade."The recent sell-off in treasuries provided a timely reminder of the type of bond market environment we may face going forward," McDade said.
