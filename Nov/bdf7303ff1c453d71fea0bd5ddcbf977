Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is considering the implications of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane’s application to interdict the release of her office’s report on state capture. Former public protector Thuli Madonsela finalised the report, in which she investigated claims the politically connected Gupta family influenced the appointment of ministers and officials at state-owned entities. Zwane on Monday joined Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen in trying to block the report. Van Rooyen withdrew his initial court application but has filed another one. President Jacob Zuma has also instituted similar action as the DA, the EFF and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor fight for the release of the report. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas earlier said a member of the Gupta family offered him Nhlanhla Nene’s job. Mentor also said the Guptas had offered her a Cabinet post. Zwane said he had not been given a chance to answer any allegations against him that might be contained in the report‚ adding the public protector "cannot confirm or deny" if the report made adverse findings against him. The High Court in Pretoria is scheduled to hear on Tuesday Zuma’s application to stop the release of the report. Zuma has applied for the matter to be postponed because of Mentor’s application. He also wants to amend his application.
