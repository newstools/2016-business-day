The chief of police in the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD)‚ Bafana Mahlabe‚ has resigned‚ the city announced on Wednesday. Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mzwandile Masina said the city received a letter of resignation from Mahlaba this week, and was left with no choice but to accept it. "Although this development was unexpected‚ after carefully considering the matter‚ I have also accepted the resignation of the chief of police because it is my view that you must avoid standing in someone’s way to pursue other ambition‚" Masina said. Mahlabe started in the position at the EMPD on October 1 2015. Gen Isaac Mapiyeye has been appointed the acting chief of metro police from December 1. The process to get a new chief will begin at Thursday’s council sitting. TMG Digital
