The Gupta family has denied that Ajay Gupta "lied" in an interview with journalist Stephen Grootes. "The rights of Ajay Gupta are reserved and appropriate steps will be taken against Grootes in the appropriate forum," the family said in a statement. "Grootes is also invited to substantiate his false, defamatory claim." This follows an opinion piece written by Grootes earlier this week, where he alleged that Ajay Gupta "lied" "several times" in an interview nine months ago. Details of the interview, arranged through the Guptas’ UK-based public relations firm Bell Pottinger, have just come to light. Grootes said he never had the opportunity to broadcast the interview and was disappointed when was not allowed to talk about it. The video of the interview leaked on YouTube this week, allowing Grootes to finally speak out about it. In an article headed "The interview I couldn’t publish until now", Grootes, described the interview, saying: "This was a tough interview, I threw everything I had at him. Some of his answers seem to have been blatant lies, particularly his claims around [Des] van Rooyen and [Mosebenzi] Zwane. Of course, we didn’t have the state capture report then." In the article, which was also published by Daily Maverick, Grootes said: "Ajay Gupta was quite softly spoken, it took time to get under his skin. Several times he said things that I thought could not be true. At the time, back in February, the Financial Mail had broken the story about how Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane had gone to Switzerland to help the Guptas broker the deal to buy the Optimum Coal Mine from Glencore. Zwane’s spokesperson had confirmed that he did go to Switzerland. You can imagine how shocked I was when Gupta flatly denied that this was the case."
