Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation look set to proceed with court action to have National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams suspended. Attorneys for the organisations wrote to President Jacob Zuma on November 1‚ urging him to suspend Abrahams‚ as well as National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) prosecutors Torrie Pretorius and Sibongile Mzinyathi‚ pending inquiries into their fitness to hold office. The action stems from the part they played in the decision to summons Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service (SARS) officials, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, and then withdraw fraud charges against them Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation said on Monday night that the president was given until 4pm on November 7 to respond‚ but‚ "despite due delivery of the letter‚ the Presidency has seen fit publicly to deny receipt and to ask for another two weeks to respond". "Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation regard this conduct as unacceptable and have informed the president that the urgent application foreshadowed in the letter is being instituted forthwith‚" their joint statement said. The Presidency said earlier on Monday it had learnt of the letter to President Jacob Zuma from media reports. "A copy of the letter is available on the internet‚" a statement said‚ before adding: "The Presidency has checked its records and has no record of receipt of this correspondence." It was information contained in an affidavit in Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation’s court challenge to the fraud charges against Gordhan‚ Pillay and Magashula that largely led to Abrahams’s about-turn.
