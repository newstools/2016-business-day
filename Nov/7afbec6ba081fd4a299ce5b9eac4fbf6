THE spike in Mozambican syndicate crime along the KwaZulu-Natal border is nothing new.So many cars were stolen in SA and spirited across the border into Mozambique from 2005 to 2007 that local leaders appealed to then safety and security minister Charles Nqakula to visit the area and see for himself.Nqakula obliged. By early 2008, talks between South African and Mozambican officials led to the establishment of a special base for South African border police in the Mozambican town of Salamanga, about 55km from border in Kosi Bay.Chief Mabhudu Tembe of the Tembe clan in KwaZulu-Natal said: "After the effort we took together with minister Nqakula there was a huge difference. Kingpins of the crime syndicates were arrested and sentenced to long spells in jail. We need similar efforts now," he said.But the problem never went away entirely, and its victims included tourism firms.A few years ago, a gang swooped on the Thonga Beach Lodge at St Lucia Wetlands, robbing guests and stealing five 4x4s, including a BMW X5 and two Land Cruisers. The BMW X5 was found abandoned in Mozambique.Crime victims living along the border travelled to Mozambique to find and negotiate for the release of their vehicles. One businessman in the border town of Manguzi told how his bakkie was taken at gunpoint."I went to Maputo and paid two informers who helped me find my vehicle in a small town north of Maputo," he said. "After we found it, we had to pay gang members to release it. I paid more bribes to Mozambican police to release my vehicle so I could bring it back to SA."
