Isaac Dintwe is a step close to becoming the next inspector-general of intelligence after he got a two-thirds vote in the National Assembly on Tuesday.The position has been vacant and the office leaderless for over 18 months.A total 299 MPs voted in favour of Dintwe&rsquo;s appointment and 14 voted "no". There were no abstentions.All that is required now is President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s final sign off.However, there are question marks around Dintwe. No sooner had his candidacy been announced did an image of him pictured with ANC top brass surface. Now it has emerged that Dintwe was a witness in Police Minister Nathi Nhleko&rsquo;s unsuccessful court bid to have Robert McBride removed.Joint standing committee chairman Charles Nqakula said he was satisfied with its candidate, but the Intelligence Services Oversight Act needed to be amended to allow for a "deputy" to serve when the position is vacant or when the incumbent is unable to perform.DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said he supported the appointment, but it was an indictment on the National Assembly that members allowed this position to be vacant for a year and a half."We support Dr Dintwe s selection and have concerns about the photographs and affidavit. But we believe he was the best as he is not executive minded as is untainted by history in the intelligence services."EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said he could not participate in the committee s selection process because he had not yet been fully vetted. He rejected the appointment of Dintwe."Out intelligence services have done nothing to address the daily challenges of fighting crime, gangs and syndicates that attack South Africans daily. This comes as Zuma is surrounded by bodyguards," said Ndlozi.NFP MP Sibusiso Mncwabe said: "Dintwe was our preferred candidate because of his outstanding performance in the interview and he is seen to be uninfluenced by party politics. The adverse effect of not having an inspector of intelligence means there is currently no formal oversight on intelligence."UDM MP Nqabayomzi Nkwankwa said government had to make the choice between continuing to use intelligence institutions for political infighting or using it to build an intelligence office that protects national security.
