Three months after the close of its interim period, Oakbay Resources has informed shareholders that its loss in the six months to end-August is expected to be R65.2m, which is 50% greater than the R43.5m loss reported for the corresponding period a year earlier. The headline loss increased to 5.3c a share from the restated 4.2c loss at the 2015 interim. Oakbay’s sponsor and corporate adviser, River Group, said the increased loss was mainly due to the effect of an additional R61m in depreciation and amortisation charges. The full interim results, which are due out on or about November, will allow shareholders to determine what progress has been made with its Brakfontein coal project. The acquisition of the Brakfontein project was completed in late February 2016, just ahead of the close of the financial year. The group, which was initially focused on uranium assets through Shiva Uranium, said at the release of its 2016 results in June that it planned to "position itself as a significant miner and supplier of energy-related natural resources". Monday’s trading update suggests financial 2017 will see no relief from the difficult conditions referred to by CEO Jacques Roux. In June, Roux said the difficulties were due to the "adverse and intense media interest surrounding the company’s major shareholder", the Gupta family. The difficulties included the loss of the group’s external auditors, its sponsor and its bankers. In addition, chairman Atul Gupta and CEO Varun Gupta resigned in April. Roux was appointed as CEO and Nazeem Howa was appointed to the board in June. The group has replaced its external auditor and sponsor, but has still been unable to recruit a South African bank. In October Howa said he was retiring due to ill health. Oakbay’s share price was unchanged at R19, where it had been since late August when the Gupta family said its businesses in SA would be sold.
