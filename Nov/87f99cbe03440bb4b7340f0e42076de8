Outspoken DA MP Makashule Gana has been given a position in the Gauteng legislature as the party ramps up efforts to govern SA after the 2019 elections. The relocation, which he requested, has been seen by some as a way for Gana to position himself as the premier candidate in the province. However, Gana dismissed that on Friday. "If people feel like I need to be the premier candidate, we will have that conversation," he said. By leaving Parliament for Gauteng, Gana hopes to secure a win for the party in 2019. Gana, who lives in Riverlea, said he would focus on his constituency in Soweto. However, the party has been criticised by township residents for being pro-white, with some black people viewing it with suspicion and hostility. Gana himself claimed to be a victim of racism within the DA, he told the Sunday Times earlier this year. In the run-up to the local elections, DA leader Mmusi Maimane got a frosty welcome from some voters in Midvaal, who said the party was too white and would never do anything for them. "People have that perception [of racism]. "What it is actually saying to us as a party is that we need to be at the forefront in terms of fighting racism in society," he said.
