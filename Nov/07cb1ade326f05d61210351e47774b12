You wouldn&rsquo;t know it to look at it, but when the facelifted Volkswagen Golf arrives in SA in the second quarter of 2017, it will bring with it step changes in technology.It will put in two all-new 1.5l engines, swap the six-speed dual-clutch transmission out for an all-new seven speeder and it will use gesture control to operate the multimedia functions for the first time in the small car class.The Golf VII.V (7.5, as they&rsquo;re insisting on calling what everybody else would regard as a facelift) will also deliver a major step in autonomous technology, with the ability to temporarily brake, steer and accelerate by itself.The upgrade will usher in an era of standard LED tail lights and optional LED headlights, including the animated turning indicators introduced by Audi.Improved economyWhile the design is largely the same and the underpinnings are nearly identical to the Golf VII, there are new engines with improved economy. And the GTi gets even more power and a brighter, shinier red strip across the grille to denote its extra performance.Though he pushed BMW to deliver a 1.5l three-cylinder engine during his time as the Bavarian company&rsquo;s development boss, Volkswagen brand chief Herbert Diess has now delivered a pair of four-cylinder 1.5 motors for VW.There will be a new direct-injection, turbocharged 1.5l petrol motor, plus a diesel four-cylinder with the same capacity. The engines are more expensive to build but lighter and more economical than the 1.4 petrol engine and 1.6 TDI they replace.There will also be a fuel-sipping 96kW BlueMotion version, with 200Nm of torque from only 1,000r/min, which delivers a sailing mode that decouples the engine when the driver lifts off the throttle and uses a radical combustion technology derived from the Miller Cycle technology Audi uses in the A4.The new engine will find its way into 2017&rsquo;s all-new Polo, the Tiguan, the Audi A1 and A3."It will be an evolutionary step for the petrol engine up from the 1.4," Diess explained at 2016&rsquo;s Detroit motor show."The diesel engine will also be a development down from the 1.6 turbo."The GTi hot hatch sees its power output jump from 162kW to 169kW. VW has yet to make claims about the new performance data, but we expect the stock GTi to whip to 100km/h in 6.4 seconds.The Golf gains some serious partly autonomous tech for its price tag, delivering everything from autonomous city braking to traffic-jam assist and lane-keeping assistance.Its radar-guided active cruise control is upgraded.For city driving, the radar and a camera ahead of the rear-view mirror combine to deliver a pedestrian-detection system that combines with a host of other electronically governed systems to stop the car automatically, even if the driver ignores the car&rsquo;s initial warning.While the car has the ability to move autonomously in a traffic jam, taking the steering, accelerating and braking tasks away from the driver, it still demands the driver keeps his or her hands on the wheel to smooth out the changeovers when the car needs to hand back control.Its new lane-keeping assistant has been designed to keep the car in the centre of the lane, rather than near one edge, and will choose the middle lane out of three as its default choice, though it will stay wherever the driver tells it to.If all that fails, it s equipped with a pre-crash setup, which pre-tensions the seat belts to hold the driver tight and in the best airbag-protection position.Should all that fail to keep the car straight, it now has automatic accident reporting and places an automatic call to emergency authorities after a crash, reporting the car s location.Its parking-assistance systems have been upgraded and the Golf can now self-park in parallel parks or in 90 , rear-first parks.When it comes to the interior, the headline act is gesture control, but it s ably supported by larger, higher-resolution touchscreens and the introduction of the Active Info Display (Audi s Virtual Cockpit).NavigationAn easy fit, due to the Golf and the Audi A3 sharing their MQB architectures, the system uses a 12.3-inch screen to replace the analogue instrumentation dials and can be configured in five different layouts with the navigation shown in either 2D or 3D.All the Golf s infotainment systems have been upgraded, with the standard five-inch and optional 6.5-inch screens pushed up to an eight-inch unit. Gesture control comes to the Golf only in the Discover Pro unit, which features a 9.2-inch touchscreen.The gesture control works by swiping your hand horizontally to move through menu screens for the audio system, radio stations and the playlists, while it backs up the visual indications with an audible tone to tell you a choice has been made. The system is governed by proximity sensors in the multimedia unit and is backed up with voice controls and old-fashioned touch controls on the screen.The connectivity takes care of most smartphones, hooking them into the car s own stronger antenna, through MirrorLink, CarPlay and AndroidAuto.The Golf facelift is considered by Diess to be the first car from Volkswagen s Future Pact plan, which will see it launch 10 new cars in 2017 and renew the complete line-up by 2020.
