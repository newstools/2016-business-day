South African bonds were largely unchanged at midday on Thursday, showing little reaction to a sharp spike in US treasury yields.At 11.31am the benchmark R186 was bid at 8.800% from 8.790% and the R207 was bid at 8.030% from 8.015%.The US 10-year treasury bond weakened 9.41% to yield 2.0304% at the same time as investors sold out of bonds on concerns that incoming US president Donald Trump would follow a loose fiscal policy.The UK 10-year gilt rose 2.67% to 1.1704%.Market concern is that local bonds could soon be following the global steepening trend."SA should get particularly hit in the coming months on a steeper US yield curve," Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto said.Trump&rsquo;s victory poses a challenge to global bond markets as he is perceived to favour laxity in fiscal policy."Long-term US bonds could come under pressure if markets perceive Trump&rsquo;s policies to widen the budget deficit," Blackrock analysts said in a note.According to Blackrock, emerging market assets could sell off in the short term due to their reliance on trade and investor sentiment. "Mexico looks vulnerable due to its dependence on exports to the US," Blackrock said.Local bonds have been the best-performing local asset class for the year so far. The R186 has delivered growth of 9.94% in 2016.
