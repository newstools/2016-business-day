San Juan &mdash; Lionel Messi produced a magical display to get Argentina&rsquo;s World Cup qualification back on track on Tuesday, while Brazil notched their sixth consecutive victory to put one foot in the 2018 finals in Russia.Messi curled home a stunning 27m free-kick and set up goals for Lucas Pratto and Angel Di Maria in a 3-0 victory over Colombia in San Juan.The win elevated Argentina into the qualifying places after they had taken just two points in their previous four games.Messi and his Argentina teammates imposed a media boycott after the final whistle. Messi said they were incensed by a claim by an Argentinian journalist that forward Ezequiel Lavezzi had been caught smoking marijuana in the camp. Lavezzi, not on the substitutes bench against Colombia, has denied the claims."We have made the decision not to talk to the media.&hellip; You know why," said Messi."There were a lot of accusations, a lot of disrespect, and the accusations they made against &lsquo;Pocho&rsquo; [Lavezzi] are very serious," he said."We can be criticised if we lose, or win, or if we play well or badly. But this is getting into personal lives. If we don t put a stop to it now, we ll never stop it."The win left Argentina in fifth spot in the 10-team standings, with 19 points from 12 games.The top four sides qualify automatically for the finals in 2018 while the fifth-placed team go into a play-off with the first-placed from the Oceania zone.Colombia slipped to sixth place after the defeat, one point behind Argentina.Brazil appear to be coasting towards Russia.
