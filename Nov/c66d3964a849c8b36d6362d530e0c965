Ian Callum had spent a lifetime designing cars without once needing to deliver an SUV. Now Jaguar&rsquo;s sketcher-in-chief has two.And if the F-Pace was a game changer for Jaguar, the all-electric I-Pace could very well be a game changer for the entire premium car segment when it goes on sale in SA in the spring of 2018.Only a year ago, the company&rsquo;s stablemates, Land Rover and Range Rover, did the SUVs while Jag watched booming crossover and SUV sales head across to Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.Instead of being behind the bell curve in the move to electric cars, this time Jaguar plans to be out in front of the mainstream premium brands. It&rsquo;s promising the I-Pace will reach production little changed from this concept car to be a full-sized SUV with 500km of range from a single charge and a sprint time to 100km/h in about four seconds.Most of the German wave of premium electric cars is expected around 2020 with BMW promising to electrify the X3 in 2021. The timing relates to the EU tightening up its emission laws and demanding big battery-electric vehicle (BEV) volumes. Jaguar promises to get there two years earlier than that, in a practical daily driver that handles like a proper Jag.And it won t limit its BEV wave to just one model, with the 4,680mm I-Pace built on scalable electric architecture that can stretch up to full Range Rover size and down to a smaller sedan or SUV.The five-seat crossover sits its lithium-ion battery pack and its alloy housing beneath the passenger compartment, making it an integral part of the chassis architecture, and losing the engine compartment gives it a cabin size and layout advantage over the acclaimed F-Pace.It will be all-wheel drive, with each axle using its own electric motor, the two of which combine for around 294kW and an F-Type SVR-equalling 700Nm of instant torque. It will carry over the software-driven off-road abilities of the F-Pace.Jaguar insists it will take just two hours to fully charge the I-Pace through a 50kW fast-charging DC station or provide 100km of range from a 150kW charger in just 10 minutes. Opt for a 7kW AC wallbox charger and you will be looking at a full charge time of about 13 hours.Jaguar SA advises that it is still working on infrastructure and charging plans for the local market and did not rule out jumping into bed with the existing EV charging partnership of BMW and Nissan.In 2016 the company became an early adopter for the all-electric Formula E championship and insists it has used that expertise to design and engineer the batteries, electric motors and governing software in-house.New architecture"This is an uncompromised electric vehicle designed from a clean sheet of paper: we ve developed a new architecture and selected only the best technology available," Jaguar Land Rover s technical development leader, Wolfgang Ziebart, says."The I-Pace concept fully exploits the potential EVs can offer in space utilisation, driving pleasure and performance."Beneath the floor, the lithium-ion battery pack uses 36 pouch cells and Jag claims they deliver lower-than-usual internal resistance and have potential greater energy density development without altering the housing or the external design.The I-Pace runs a dual-mode liquid cooling circuit. In typical ambient temperature ranges it relies solely on radiator cooling to take the cell heat from the cooling liquid. If the weather gets properly hot (Jaguar doesn t specify exactly how hot that is), it switches across to a chilled circuit linked to the car s air-conditioning unit.There s also a heat pump integrated into the car s climate-control system, designed to draw energy from outside air to heat the cabin rather than drawing current down from the battery.While the I-Pace is a two-pedal car, Jaguar also insists the driver can ramp up the level of regenerative braking to effectively turn it into a one-pedal car, with the car s maximum regeneration allowing the driver to just use a throttle lift-off instead of braking."Electric vehicles are inevitable Jaguar will make them desirable. Zero emission cars are here to stay and the I-Pace concept is at the cutting edge of the electric vehicle revolution," Jaguar s vehicle line director Ian Hoban says."As the charging infrastructure continues to develop globally and with enough range to mean most people would only need to charge once a week cars like the I-Pace concept will make drivers appreciate that an EV can be rewarding and practical enough to drive every day."The second ever SUV from the pen of Jaguar design director, Ian Callum, the I-Pace retains a conventionally large grille, even though it s not necessary for cooling, and has slashed its drag coefficient to just 0.29."This isn t just a concept. It is a preview of a five-seat production car that will be on the road in 2018," Callum says."This will be Jaguar s first ever battery-powered electric vehicle and opens a new chapter in the history of our legendary brand.""The opportunities offered by an electric powertrain are huge. Electric vehicles offer designers much greater freedom, and it is an opportunity we must grasp. This is why the I-Pace concept is developed on a new architecture, which has been designed to optimise electric vehicle performance, aerodynamics and interior space."JLR s chief engineer of vehicle integrity, Mike Cross, says: "It s true that Jaguar will prove that a zero emission vehicle can be a true driver s car."We proved with the F-Pace that a performance crossover can deliver the agility, connected feel and ride quality you d expect from a Jaguar."Now we re going to do the same with the I-Pace concept: this will be the first electric vehicle developed for enthusiasts who love driving."With no engine bay to bother it, the cab-forward design allows the 4,680mm I-Pace to run with short overhangs, 530l of luggage space at the rear and a Lamborghini-esque 28l luggage compartment in the nose.It runs a permanent WiFi connection and continues Jaguar s flight deck interior control philosophy, delivering a 12-inch touchscreen for most of its controls and a secondary 5.5-inch touchscreen, paired to two laser-etched aluminium rotary dials, that let people change the infotainment and climate control settings without interrupting the main display s screen.Display unitA 12-inch virtual instrument cluster sits in front of the driver, along with a full colour head-up display unit.The reveal of the I-Pace will have executives at BMW and Tesla dashing off to meetings and we will not be surprised to see some promised models being brought forward.Jaguar SA is promising that the I-Pace will arrive in SA with a premium of 10%-15% over the price of a F-Pace. Jaguar has thrown down a major gauntlet and rather than keeping pace, it is suddenly setting the pace.
