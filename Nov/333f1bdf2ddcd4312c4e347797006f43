President Jacob Zuma was at pains to fend off questions from MPs on former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report on state capture.In written replies to questions from MPs, Zuma said repeatedly that the questions relate to Madonsela&rsquo;s report, the last report she released before the end of her seven-year nonrenewable term.The report was the subject of interdicts by Zuma, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.The report&rsquo;s remedial actions include the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the relationship between Zuma, cabinet ministers and the Gupta family. Zuma pointed out that the court challenges do not allow him to comment on the issue."The questions asked form part of the subject matter of the report into allegations of improper and unethical conduct by the president and other state functionaries on matters relating to the removal and appointment of ministers and executives of state-owned enterprises," answered Zuma in at least nine of the 13 questions he responded to.The questions came mostly from DA MPs, including Glynnis Breytenbach, Tandeka Gqada, David Maynier, chief whip John Steenhuisen and DA leader Mmusi Maimane.Zuma said the remedial actions set out in the report were inconclusive. Due to legal challenges, Zuma said he could not answer any questions on the report's contents.Gqada asked Zuma for details of his home loan from VBS Mutual Bank to pay back the R7.8m of taxpayers&rsquo; money spent on nonsecurity upgrades at his private Nkandla homestead.Madonsela&rsquo;s report (Secure in Comfort) recommended that the president pay back portion of the money spent as he benefited unduly. The Treasury determined the amount to be paid."I raised the amount R7.8m through a home loan obtained from VBS Mutual Bank on its standard terms &hellip; After paying over the amount &hellip; to the South African Reserve Bank, I as a matter of courtesy, advised the Constitutional Court that I have paid the amount as per the order of that court," he said.Zuma was also quizzed about Zwane&rsquo;s statement on banks closing accounts of Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments, hinting at an inquiry into the financial institutions.Responding to a Maynier question, Zuma said the minister issued the statement in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the task team or cabinet."I am not in the position to answer why the minister Zwane in his reply on 22 September 2016 said that he was not speaking in his personal capacity. The question in this regard must be directed to the minister. I reprimanded the minister for the statement," Zuma said.
