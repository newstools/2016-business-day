The South African bond market was weaker at midday on Tuesday as it awaited more detail from the ANC press conference at 2pm on the national executive committee (NEC) meeting at the weekend where a bid was made to unseat President Jacob Zuma. The weaker rand served as catalyst for a softer bond market, with the R186 poised to weaken beyond 9% again. Firmer US treasuries provided little support. At 11.37am the R186 10-year bond was bid at 8.990% from 8.880% on Monday. The R207 was bid at 8.230% from a previous 8.135%. The rand was at R13.9789 to the dollar from a previous R13.7216. Bonds received some respite on Monday, with the R186 breaking below the 8.90% level, as the ratings announcements over the weekend by Fitch and Moody’s allayed concerns of an immediate downgrade ahead of S&P Global Ratings’ announcement on Friday. The bond market recorded marginal inflows last week. "What remains a concern is the fact that bond inflows have eased sharply in recent weeks, amid a bond market rout after the US elections," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. Foreign sentiment would likely remain volatile amid geopolitical risks, along with local political event risks, Nedbank said. US treasuries have improved yields again after the unexpected Donald Trump victory in the US, which saw yields spike, as the "elastic was somewhat stretched", said Stanlib retail investment director Paul Hansen. Treasuries were clearly in overbought territory. "But we have seen some pull back from 2.41% to 2.32% in the 10-year US treasury," he said, noting that yields were at 1.78% in early November. At midday on Tuesday the US 10-year was at 2.3259% from 2.3581%, 1.37% firmer on the day.
