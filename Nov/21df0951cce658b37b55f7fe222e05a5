Eskom will proceed with its request for proposal for 9,600MW of nuclear power this year to test the market, says Matshelo Koko, the utility&rsquo;s head of generation.Koko attended Tuesday&rsquo;s media briefing where Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson released details of the integrated energy plan and integrated resource plan.Under the draft base case energy plan for SA, gas and renewable energy will provide the biggest chunk of new installed capacity by 2050.The plan envisages 20,000MW of new nuclear capacity being incorporated into the grid by 2037.A price of $5.4m per megawatt of nuclear energy has been used for the scenario planning.Koko said a 10-year lead time would be required for the construction of the nuclear plants, which was why Eskom would proceed with its request for proposals for 9,600MW nuclear procurement this year to test the market.He emphasised that testing the market was not the same as entering a contract.Koko said the plan was to construct a number of small nuclear reactors: the first, of 1,359MW, would be constructed by 2025; another of 2,718MW by end-2027; one of 1,359MW by end-2029; and another of 1,359MW by end-2030.This staggered roll-out takes into account the affordability of the programme.Eskom would have to advise the Cabinet on the best roll-out scenario for the fleet.Koko insisted Eskom would aim for a levelised generation cost at or below 100c per kilowatt hour from nuclear to make it a viable option."If it is higher than that it is not going to fly," he said.
