Legal lobby groups Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation&rsquo;s urgent high court case to have Shaun Abrahams suspended has been dismissed as "ill-advised and unreasonable".The High Court in Pretoria threw out the case, saying it was not urgent.Calls for Abraham to resign or be suspended by President Jacob Zuma came in thick and fast after he announced on October 11 that the National Prosecuting Authority had charged Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for fraud, only to withdraw the charges weeks later.The two lobby groups went to the court urgently, asking it to set aside Zuma&rsquo;s "failure" to suspend and initiate inquiries into whether Abrahams, acting head of the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit Torie Pretorius SC and Gauteng director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi were fit for their posts.But a full bench of three judges Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba and Judge Elizabeth Kubushi said the rush to court was "ill-advised and unreasonable".The two organisations had originally written to the president demanding the suspensions, failing which they would go to court. When he responded, requesting more time, they rejected his request and instituted their court case.The president then, on November 14, wrote to Abrahams, Pretorius and Mzinyathi asking why they should not be suspended.Mlambo said when Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation wrote their first letter to Zuma, their minds were made up that the president had no option but to accede to their demand.But the president s request for time was not unreasonable, he said. The bench was also not persuaded that it was irrational for the president to ask for representations.In a stern rebuke Mlambo said: "We should also guard against creating precedents where, based on insufficient grounds and inadequate foundation, (we) encourage ordinary citizens to use the courts to dictate to the executive how to do its work."The Helen Suzman Foundation s Francis Antonie and Freedom Under Law s Nicole Fritz said they needed to consult with their lawyers before deciding on their way forward.
