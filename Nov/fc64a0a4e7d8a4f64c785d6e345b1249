The rand was on a firmer footing on Tuesday morning, partially reflecting a pause in the dollar’s rally that has been the currency of choice since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. The local currency has regained about 20c against the dollar to R14.30 in the past 24 hours, although it remained significantly below last week’s best level around R13.17. ETM Analytics market analyst Ricardo da Camara said rand was poised to recover in the short term. "We had big moves on the rand that reflected substantial portfolio outflows and not necessarily underlying economic fundamentals," Da Camara said. The recent blowout in the rand was in sympathy with its emerging-market peers that have reeled amid the expectation of high inflation pressures under a Trump administration, which could result in steep rises in US interest rates. The weaker rand environment poses a potential threat to SA’s inflation outlook, which has been moderating since peaking at 7% earlier in the year. "So far, emerging markets are in the firing line as we expect sharper increases in the US interest rates from next year, which will keep [emerging markets] under pressure to follow suit or risk their currency blowing out," TreasuryOne dealer Andre Botha said. "The big movers at the moment are the US treasury yields ... keep a close eye on that if you want a firm understanding where the rand is going." At 9am, the rand was at R14.3009 to the dollar from Monday’s R14.4356. It was at R15.3722 to the euro from R15.4991 and R17.8429 to the pound from R18.0363 The euro was at $1.0751, from $1.0739.
