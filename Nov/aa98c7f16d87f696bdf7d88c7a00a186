Mining production grew 3.4% in September compared with a year earlier, in line with expectations for a rebound in the moribund sector and offering some positive news for third-quarter economic growth.The rise broke a run of 12 months of contraction in the sector, which has been under a pressure from a long period of low global economic growth and low commodity prices.Thursday&rsquo;s data from Statistics SA conclude the sector&rsquo;s releases for the third quarter.Output for the quarter was up 1.5% compared with the previous quarter.Manufacturing data are due later in the day. The two sectors account for about a fifth of SA&rsquo;s gross domestic products growth, so the mining production increase is some good news on that front, although manufacturing output is expected to have shrunk.Economists do not expect a repeat of what occurred in the second quarter, when A resurgence in manufacturing and mining output drove a big turnaround in real GDP growth &mdash; to 3.3% quarter on quarter, from a shock 1.2% contraction in the first quarter.The long run of contractions mean the sector&rsquo;s output for the year to end-September is still 5.7% weaker than the same period last year &mdash; though this is an improvement on the 6.8% decline in the year to August.Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan traces the sector&rsquo;s underperformance to a multitude of factors, from increased operating costs to weaker commodity demand from China and low commodity prices."Commodity prices are widely expected to stabilise but remain suppressed, reflecting relatively weak global growth," said Kaplan.Global growth is expected to rise to about 3% this year &mdash; the slowest pace of expansion since the 2008-09 global financial crisis.Compared with August, mining production was 0.9% higher in September.The main positive contributors to the year-on-year increase were:&bull; platinum group metals (rising 10.5% and contributing 2.1 percentage points);&bull; iron ore (11.7% and contributing two percentage points); and&bull;coal (6.8% and contributing 1.6 percentage points).
