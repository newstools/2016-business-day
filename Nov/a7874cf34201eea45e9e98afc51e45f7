Refusing to resign, the chief financial officer of the Department of International Relations and Co-operation has dared staff who had accused him of financial misconduct to come forward with proof.Staff in the finance division claimed in a letter that Caiphus Ramashau had cozy relationships with businesses servicing the department and had scored a bakkie and a home from his dealings with them. Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts has referred the matter to the Hawks.In the letter Ramashau is said to have travelled abroad for a course "which has nothing to do with his day job", and this had cost the department R250,000."As if that is not enough, the procurement was flawed but you didn&rsquo;t care. We know you later instructed that it should be rectified. We have the documents. The policies of the department were not adhered to," the letter read.Ramashau told Business Day he had nothing to answer for because his accusers had made claims behind a veil of anonymity and would not substantiate or prove the claims with documented evidence."The issue is if someone says something and they are anonymous, what is my role in responding to that? I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. If anyone has information they must come forward and give it to the relevant authorities," he said."I have received nothing that I must answer to. I don&rsquo;t approve tenders. I don&rsquo;t know what you want me to tell you on that front, because that is not even my job," Ramashau said.He had not heard from the department or the Hawks about the accusations, he said, and until he did, he would stay put in his job.Spokesman Clayson Monyela said the department preferred to allow the Hawks the opportunity to investigate before making any comments.
