Rugby star Bryan Habana is genetically predisposed to being a good athlete‚ but he needs to avoid moist cakes‚ freshly baked bread and milk. The Springbok wing has disclosed personal information about what his genetic make-up says about his sporting performance‚ after becoming one of the first professional rugby players in the world to have had his DNA tested. This is part of a challenge to rugby players across the world to have their DNA analysed by UK-based biotechnology company DNAFit, to create the largest rugby genetic database in the sporting world "The data will help the sporting world to break into new frontiers of training‚ preparation and injury avoidance‚ making players and teams more successful and opening a new realm of sports medicine‚" Habana said in a statement on Friday. Setting the ambitious target of 1‚000 rugby samples genotyped for research and analysis by the end of 2018‚ Habana said he had released his personal genetic code and associated information "to encourage other players from around the world to do their DNA test and help build this very important database". Habana did a mouth swab test from DNAFit to collect a DNA sample‚ which looked at 45 genes known to determine power‚ endurance and recovery. Analysing his results and looking back at his career‚ Habana said: "Looking at these results and what they say about my genetic make-up means that I probably could have pushed myself further in certain areas, and who knows the difference this could have made?" "It’s sometimes that 1%‚ the smallest of margins that can be the difference between winning and losing. This information and data gives you that edge‚" he added.
