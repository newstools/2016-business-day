The rand continued to recover against the dollar at midday on Tuesday as pressure from long-term US treasury yields eased and the dollar stabilised at marginally weaker levels.The rand also performed well against the pound and euro.The local currency has been boosted by proposals made on labour reform in a report that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa presented to the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on Sunday.Among the reforms are the proposals to increase the minimum wage to R3500/month and to implement a second strike ballot that would form part of measures to curb lengthy and violent strikes. Unions are against the second strike ballot proposal.At 11:29am, the rand was at R14.0719 to the dollar from Monday&rsquo;s R14.2266. It was at R14.9900 to the euro from R15.1204 and R17.5786 to the pound from R17.7710The euro was at $1.0652, from $1.0627.Wichard Cilliers, head of dealing and a director at TreasuryOne, said the local currency&rsquo;s reprieve might not last long.The rand could also be affected by the rating agency Moody&rsquo;s credit rating decision on Friday, although he said a downgrade to junk was doubtful."We&rsquo;re rated two notches above junk with them, and a double downgrade seems unlikely," said Cilliers.
