The rand settled into a relatively stable band on Friday morning near the end of a fairly busy week during which the local currency stood its ground against the rampant dollar. Moody’s will take centre stage later in the day when it reviews SA’s credit rating, although analysts have said that the effect of its decision was likely to be limited on the markets compared with S&P Global Ratings’ decision. Moody’s has the country’s credit rating a couple of notches above subinvestment grade status, unlike S&P, which ranks the country’s foreign currency debt one level above so-called junk status "The consensus is for nothing to happen and many feel it won’t be a significant factor in today’s market movements unless Moody’s totally blindsides us with a double downgrade," said Wichard Cilliers, head of dealing and a director at TreasuryOne. The rand stood its ground against the strong dollar, which drew support from the increased expectation of higher US interest rates. At 9am, the rand was at R14.1135 to the dollar from Thursday’s R14.1495. It was at R14.9296 to the euro from R14.9299 and R17.5806 to the pound from R17.6151 The euro was at $1.0578 from $1.0553.
