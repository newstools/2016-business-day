Free-to-air television broadcaster e.tv managed to grow revenue 10% and maintain market share, its JSE-listed holding company eMedia reported on Wednesday morning.The group&rsquo;s overall revenue grew 11% to R1.3bn in the six months to end-September, but aftertax profit declined 16% to R103m.This decline was mainly due to R136.9m invested in "multi-channel businesses from which very little revenue is currently being derived", the company said in its results statement.eMedia said its digital terrestrial television service OpenView HD had installed 149,894 set-top boxes during the reporting period, taking its total to 538,706.The group&rsquo;s eSat.tv division, which operates under the brand ENCA, "continues to be the most watched 24-hour news station on DStv with over 50% market share".Although its agreement with Naspers-owned DStv expired on May 31, DStv did not give notice and negotiations are under way for a new agreement that should be in place before eMedia&rsquo;s financial year ends on March 31.Regarding e.tv, eMedia said: "A shift to include &lsquo;high-end&rsquo; international series and movies and recent deals concluded with Warner and Disney have assisted in clawing back and maintaining the market share that had been lost previously."Although e.tv lost its legal action against the government regarding SA&rsquo;s digital terrestrial television policies, it did win the right to appeal. The case is scheduled to be heard in the Constitutional Court in February.Disposals during the reporting period included Power Entertainment, TVPC Media, Shibula Lodge and e.tv&rsquo;s studios at 9 Summit Road in Dunkeld West. Negotiations are under way for the sale of eBotswana.No dividend was declared.
