London &mdash; The Springboks will fight brawn with brawn after coach Allister Coetzee picked a monstrous pack to match England at Twickenham on Saturday.Pieter-Steph du Toit, all 2.00m and 115kg of him, will start at flank with human battering ram Willem Alberts operating on the other side of the scrum.Du Toit will wear No7 and Alberts No6 but that will be irrelevant as neither will be a specialist openside.It is a case of everyone mucking in at the breakdown this weekend while the pair will make strong target runners."I&rsquo;ve selected the best possible team to supply us with possession and go forward. On Saturday the gainline will be the key battle," Bok coach Allister Coetzee said."This game can&rsquo;t be played without some form of physicality and without gainline dominance. You have to earn that and I believe this pack suits the way we want to play this game."Pieter-Steph has played exceptionally well, has a phenomenal work rate and he has played a lot at flank."He runs great lines so he is suited to that role."Willem is experienced and [has] been to Twickenham before and performed well here as well."Du Toit will also bolster the lineout, and with Lood de Jager starting in the second row, captain and hooker Adriaan Strauss will have many options in the set piece.England coach Eddie Jones knew what was coming when he named his team hours before the Boks. He unsurprisingly picked a huge back row as well with Tom Wood coming in to play openside.And like the Boks the English team do not have a specialist openside a factor that neither camp seem overly concerned about for this encounter."Have SA ever picked an openside?" Jones asked with a twinkle in his eye. "They give an openside No6 and can t even get the number right."Our No 7 is all about the defensive effort."It s all about stopping the opposition getting to the gainline. He [Wood] knows his job, has worked very hard to get back into the team, is an experienced player and he has really been a welcome addition to the squad."Coetzee also handed a first Test cap to centre Francois Venter, who will become Springbok No877 and the 45th Bok from Bloemfontein s Grey College."Having worked with Francois for the last three weeks, I was impressed with [his] organisational skills and leadership," Coetzee said."He s an experienced player, having played a lot of Super Rugby with the Bulls and Cheetahs. He also understands the defensive role as well."He has looked comfortable next to Damian de Allende in training since we got together and he understands his role on defence really well."It s also a form of continuity because we only have five or so players carrying over from the Barbarians match so it was important to keep halfbacks Rudy Paige and Pat Lambie together as well as Francois."
