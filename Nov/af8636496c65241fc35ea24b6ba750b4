Springbok coach Allister Coetzee, who arrived home on Monday from a disastrous European tour, has likened his perilous position to that of a predecessor, Jake White.In 2006, White narrowly escaped the sack after a 49-0 drubbing in Australia and a year later guided the Springboks to victory over England in the World Cup final.White lost seven Tests during the pre-World Cup season and Coetzee suffered a record eight defeats this year in 12 internationals, the worst return in 125 years of Bok rugby.Touring Europe in November, the Boks were beaten 37-21 by England, 20-18 by Italy and 27-13 by Wales."Every coach goes through a rough year," the former Stormers handler told reporters at OR Tambo International Airport."I would rather take the defeats at the beginning of my tenure than experience a slump during the third year. Results can only get better from here."This now is a massive opportunity for SA Rugby to not only plaster over the cracks, but to clean it up."We&rsquo;ve got six months until we get back together again and need to spend that time wisely, planning for how we&rsquo;re going to get back to the top," he said.SA were humiliated 57-15 in Durban in October by New Zealand, a record-winning margin between the rugby rivals.In 2016, the Springboks fell to Italy for the first time, lost at home to Ireland for the first time and were defeated in Argentina for the first time.Recently appointed SA Rugby president Mark Alexander said Coetzee would be interviewed in December before a decision regarding his future was made.The former scrumhalf signed a four-year contract as successor to Heyneke Meyer last April, taking him up to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.But many Springbok supporters have vented their anger on social media at the losing streak and believe Coetzee is out of his depth as a Test coach.Coetzee defended his choice of hooker Adriaan Strauss as captain, hailing his leadership under fire."He steered this team on and off the field in a tough situation and that shows his leadership ability," said the coach.Strauss retired from Test rugby last Saturday after the defeat by Wales in Cardiff."I knew it was going to be a tough year, but it proved much harder than anticipated," admitted the former skipper."I gave it my all and did everything I could."SA return to action next June with a three-Test home series against France."I feel dreadfully sorry for Allister because he is a decent guy, but better Springbok coaches than him have been fired," said Nick Mallett, one of his predecessors and arguably the country&rsquo;s foremost rugby analyst on television.AFP, Reuters
