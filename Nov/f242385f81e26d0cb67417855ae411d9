Indications are that Iraq and Saudi Arabia may eventually provide support for the production cut agreement reached in Algiers in October, thereby boosting flagging oil prices. Global risk assets, driven by US equities, were positive about the potential for an expansionary fiscal policy from Trump, Momentum SP Reid said in an early morning note. This upside had ignited inflationary expectations, but for now risk assets were largely ignoring this possibility, which would entail higher interest rates. "Moving into the first quarter of 2017, the combination of a stronger dollar and higher yields would probably prove to be a modest headwind," Momentum said.
