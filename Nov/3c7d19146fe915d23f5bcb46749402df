South African bond yields flattened further on Wednesday morning, taking direction from a relatively stronger rand, which augurs well for the inflation outlook. The yield on the benchmark R186 was at 8.920% in early trade, from 8.950% on Tuesday. "News released that there would be a delay in the nuclear energy programme also helped support the bonds," Rand Merchant Bank analyst Gordon Kerr said. "With current growth rates a concern, the programme has been viewed in a negative light given its expensive nature and potential negative impact on the countryâ€™s credit rating." The yield on the US 10-year treasury note, which recently helped trigger bond outflows from emerging markets such as SA, was stable on Wednesday morning at 2.3139%, from 2.3145%. The rand was at R14.06 to the dollar, a big rebound from lows of R14.65 on Friday.
