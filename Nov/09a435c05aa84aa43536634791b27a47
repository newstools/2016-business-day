The National Credit Regulator (NCR) says it will appeal against a high court order setting aside recently promulgated caps on rates and fees in short-term credit agreements. The court ordered that these be reviewed after finding that neither the regulator nor the trade and industry minister had meaningfully considered the effect these caps would have on the microlending industry and the provision of short-term credit to consumers.Short-term credit refers to loans not exceeding R8,000, repayable in six months or less.The NCR and the minister had failed to comply with the requirements of the National Credit Act by not providing any research about how they arrived at the rate and fee caps on these loans, the court found.Neither party had tackled the contention of MicroFinance SA, which represented about 500 microlenders, that the amended fees and interest rates did not reflect the true cost of providing credit and would put many of its members out of business, impairing access to credit for millions of people.MicroFinance SA brought the application to have the regulations reviewed in terms of the Promotion to Administrative Justice Act, court papers say.However, the regulator s senior legal adviser, Nthupang Magolego, said it had conducted an impact assessment, as was required of the NCR.The court found that the regulator, which had provided no evidence of such an impact assessment, did not follow the recommendations of a PwC report it had commissioned.Neither could the minister support assertions that he had consulted the short-term credit industry and that he had balanced the rights of consumers and credit providers.Had PwC s recommendations been followed, the maximum service fee would have been R80.54, up from R50 previously. "Without any explanation, the regulator simply suggested an amount of R65 to the minister. The minister, also without any explanation, reduced the amount to R60," Judge J W Louw said."No reason or explanation is given for the reduction of the interest rate [on short-term loans] from 5% to 3% per month for further loans after the first. All that is referred to is a policy to reduce the overindebtedness of consumers."There is, however, no evidence that the existing initiation fee, service fee and interest&nbsp;rate were the cause of such overindebtedness."Before the regulator s review, rates and fees on all classes of credit had not been amended for nine years, despite provisions in the National Credit Act that the NCR should review them every three years.Taking this into consideration, PwC recommended rebasing the maximum fees chargeable and applying an annual inflationary increase.This recommendation was not reflected in the new rates and fees, for all classes of credit, which came into effect in May 2016.Magolego said that the regulator did not agree with the judgment and would be appealing against it.Once the appeal had been noted, the judgment would be set aside and credit providers would have to comply with the rates and fees promulgated in May. Until then, credit providers should apply the old rules pertaining to caps on rates and fees, she said.The Department of Trade and Industry said it was still studying the judgment, but it was likely that it would join the appeal.
