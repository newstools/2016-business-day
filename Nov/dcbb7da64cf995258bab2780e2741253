The South African bond market got off to a roundly positive start on Tuesday morning, tracking the recovery in the rand, which flirted with R14.20 to the dollar. The bond market sold off fairly sharply on the expectation of sharp US interest rate increases after Donald Trump swept to victory in the US presidential polls. Foreigners sold just more than R9bn worth of local bonds last week during which the rand shed 5% against the dollar and lost out against other major currencies such as the euro and pound. Higher US rates make the dollar more appealing as they boost returns on assets denominated in the currency. But on Tuesday morning, the yield on the R186 benchmark compressed to 9.100%, from 9.160%. The US 10-year note, which is at the centre of market focus, stabilised at 2.2021% on Monday morning, from 2.1509% on Monday
