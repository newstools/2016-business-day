The major opposition party has rounded on the ANC following reports of deep divisions over a move to have President Jacob Zuma removed from office. The ANC is set to make an announcement "on the outcomes of the meeting of the national executive committee" on Tuesday‚ a terse statement said on Monday night. That meeting‚ originally scheduled to run until Sunday‚ was extended until late on Monday after Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom tabled a motion of no confidence in Zuma. DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted on Tuesday morning: "Whatever the outcome of #ANCNEC deep divisions are there. Ours is to rally behind the 94 consensus of constitutionalism and prosperity 4 all". The party’s chief whip in the National Assembly‚ John Steenhuisen‚ had some advice for the anti-Zuma camp: "If those in the ANC really want to get rid of Zuma only 52 of them need to break ranks in the house for a motion of no confidence to pass!" The DA tried earlier this month to unseat Zuma in Parliament but its motion of no confidence failed. The Times has learned that some senior anti-Zuma NEC members were told to leave the meeting‚ and sources have said that former national police commissioner Bheki Cele and former police minister Nathi Mthwetwa‚ who are in Zuma’s Cabinet in other positions‚ nearly exchanged blows at the meeting on Sunday. Hanekom was reported to have been harshly criticised by Zuma sympathisers‚ with some expressing their views on social media. Party insiders said Hanekom’s motion was strongly opposed‚ placing his position in Zuma’s Cabinet in peril. One source said that among senior ANC members who were told by others to resign from the Cabinet and Parliament were Hanekom‚ Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi‚ Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor‚ Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi‚ ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.
