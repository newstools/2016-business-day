The rand was slightly firmer at midday on Friday as the market awaited the Moody’s credit rating for SA. A slightly weaker dollar also supported risk-on trade in quiet market conditions. At 11.36am the rand was at R14.1004 from a previous R14.1495. It firmed to R14.03 in intraday trade. The rand was at R14.9437 to the euro from R14.9299 and at R17.5600 to the pound from R17.6151. The euro was at $1,0598 from $1,0553. Analysts said the Moody’s announcement would probably have less effect than next week’s S&P Global Ratings’ decision. Moody’s has the country’s credit rating at Baa2 with a negative outlook, two notches above subinvestment grade status, unlike S&P, which ranks SA’s foreign currency debt only one level above junk status. Pointing out that the Mood’s rating would be made on Friday night, Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns said: "We do not expect Moody’s to make for a black Friday but it is likely to be a close call," he said.
