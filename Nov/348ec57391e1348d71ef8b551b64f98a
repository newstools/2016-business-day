A large degree of uncertainty exists on the real consequences of Brexit, which may affect the projected growth figures.Despite Chancellor Hammond s efforts to demonstrate his willingness to relax the fiscal tightening and support the economy, the government s new deficit forecasts were driven by changes in assumptions and macro forecasts, Barclays said.Barclays said over the next five years, the chancellor intended to borrow 1.1% of GDP more with 0.8 percentage points of that due to a less favourable macro backdrop and only 0.3 percentage point due to new spending measures."The growth projections may be overly optimistic," Barclays said.Among individual shares on the JSE, BHP Billiton climbed 1.31% to R39.39 and Glencore gained 1.19% to R50.06.Barloworld was up 2.81% to R104.61.
