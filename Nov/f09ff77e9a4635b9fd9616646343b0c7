Embattled SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng could go through a fresh disciplinary hearing after a concession by the SABC in court that the initial hearing, which cleared him of wrongdoing, did not fully comply with the principle of legality.The High Court in Cape Town heard a DA application on Thursday to set aside the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry that cleared Motsoeneng, and to have his permanent position as group executive of corporate affairs declared invalid.The party argued Motsoeneng was an "unethical, manipulative fraudster who has destroyed any semblance of good corporate governance at the SABC" and should not hold any influential position.Lawyers representing Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, the SABC and Motsoeneng seemed to agree in court that fresh disciplinary proceedings should be instituted.But they opposed the application to terminate his employment unless former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report is set aside by the courts. The SABC, which is challenging the report, argued it was premature for the courts to rule on Motsoeneng&rsquo;s future until its review application has been dealt with.In her 2014 report, Madonsela found Motsoeneng had fabricated a matric qualification, purged those he disagreed with, and irregularly increased his salary from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year.A disciplinary hearing cleared Motsoeneng of wrongdoing, but the DA says the process was a "sham and a charade". The hearing was one of the remedial actions directed by Madonsela in her report."There is a general agreement that there should be a new inquiry," the SABC&rsquo;s lawyer Stephan du Toit told the court. The role of a disciplinary process was not always to arrive at a dismissal. There could also be a suspension, said Du Toit."The DA trying to prescribe to SABC who they may employ &hellip; it will set a bad precedent if a political party &hellip; tells us who to employ," he said.Andy Bester, for Motsoeneng, argued that there was "no basis to terminate his [Motsoeneng&rsquo;s] employment when that is precisely the type of thing that the new disciplinary inquiry has to engage in &hellip; it prejudges the outcome of those proceedings".Anton Katz for the DA said in the face of the public protector&rsquo;s clear findings and remedial action, Motsoeneng was not an appropriate person to be appointed in any SABC position, let alone an executive position."For as long as the public protector&rsquo;s findings and remedial actions remain unchallenged, it would be irrational for any organisation in the public sector to employ Motsoeneng," said Katz.
