Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza is going to be a permanent fixture in Parliament after the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) demanded that the head of the crime-fighting unit be present at its meetings. Scopa chairman Themba Godi said on Monday its members had agreed that Ntlemeza should sit in on its meetings when the national department and state-owned entities’ officials appear before it to account for wrongdoing. "We had an engagement with Ntlemeza and came to an understanding that, every time Scopa has a hearing, he will be present so that when we pick up transactions we suspect have elements of criminality we would refer those to him for investigation," said Godi. Ntlemeza is part of the anti-corruption task team, a multi-departmental entity comprising the Hawks, the South African Revenue Service and the National Prosecuting Authority to clean up graft. However, Godi said Scopa was "not getting the sense that the executive pursued the fight against corruption as rigorously as it should". Scopa has asked the Hawks to investigate allegations of financial misconduct at the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, the Department of Basic Education, the Department of Water and Sanitation, and two sector education and training authorities. This is happening against the backdrop of auditor-general Kimi Makwetu’s release of the audit outcomes of national departments and their entities. Makwetu’s report painted a dire picture of public finances.
