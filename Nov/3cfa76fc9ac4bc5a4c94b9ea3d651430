DCD Marine, a venerable 113-year-old Cape Town-based business that serves mainly the upstream oil and gas sectors, has entered into voluntary business rescue after 18 months of "very difficult trading".The process gives the member company of the DCD Group of industrial firms the space to take action to boost its chances of survival. Established in 1903, the company undertakes turnkey repairs and upgrades on vessels such as drill ships, semi-submersible drilling rigs, offshore support vessels and pipe-laying vessels."The intention &hellip; is to give the business the best possible chance of trading through these difficult conditions," DCD Group CEO Digby Glover said on Thursday. The group saw a future for DCD Marine, but it was "less bright".The company also services remote oil and gas sites and offshore projects including in Angola and further up Africa&rsquo;s west coast. It had been focused mainly on the oil and gas market, but this had "contracted massively due to low global oil prices", Glover said.The majority of DCD Marine&rsquo;s turnover would have been from oil and gas.He estimated that annual turnover from these operations could range from several hundreds of millions of rand to more than R1bn.Market conditions had forced DCD Marine to revert its focus to ship repair and industrial markets that were smaller in scale, Glover said. The latter included marine rail and rolling stock products, he said.Global shipping markets are in disarray. Taiwan has become the latest Asian shipping power to suffer a glut of vessels and the worst trading conditions in many decades.In August, Hanjin, the giant South Korean shipping group, declared bankruptcy, and Japan&rsquo;s big three shipping conglomerates agreed to consolidate their container businesses and end a punishing price war.The DCD Group wanted to keep the marine business alive and save jobs, Glover said. But he acknowledged that only about 25% of permanent staff among more than 200 workers had remained at the company, which entered business rescue on November 10. Similar numbers of nonpermanent contractors had lost their jobs."If there was no chance of DCD Marine making it through this difficult time, the business rescue route could not have been taken," Glover said.The company also had some exposure to oil and gas markets in Mozambique. However, legislation in this market was difficult to navigate.At the same time, the country was undergoing a currency crisis, in part spurred by the non-disclosure of misspent international debt that was likely to come to more than $1bn. The International Monetary Fund has subsequently suspended funding to Mozambique.Business-rescue practitioners Neill Hobbs and Justin Gordon from Hobbs Sinclair have been appointed to administer the process."We were appointed on November 11," Gordon said."During the whole business-rescue process, companies [creditors] lodge claims we collect them and compare them to company records," he said."I am here to serve the best interests of creditors," he said. These include shareholders, employees and general creditors, in no apparent ranking.The first creditors meeting would take place on Friday, November 25, Gordon said, but it was too early to quantify outstanding claims.Deon Truter, DCD Marine shipyard manager, said no part of the business would cease to operate.Retrenchments had been a consequence of "prevailing challenging market conditions", the shipyard manager said."The decision to go into voluntary business rescue is seen as the best mechanism to save jobs, while ensuring the long-term survival and sustainability of the business," he said."All projects which we had undertaken or were busy with prior to the date of going into voluntary business rescue will proceed as normal," he said.
