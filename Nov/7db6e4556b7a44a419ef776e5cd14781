The rand eased on Tuesday morning as caution prevailed just hours before the eagerly awaited US presidential election. The local currency benefited from a surge in global risk appetite on Monday, touching R13.32 to the dollar, as investors responded favourably to the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it found no wrongdoing in Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s new e-mails. Clinton is up against the Republican rival Donald Trump in the months-long and hotly contested race to the White House. "As the US heads to the polls, traders around the world are strapping in and preparing for what could be 48 hours of substantial volatility, particularly in the event of a Donald Trump victory, an outcome the markets appear confident is now unlikely," Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. "The problem is the market has been complacent in the not too distant past, having left itself very exposed to Brexit, which resulted in some very aggressive moves in the early hours of June 24. I don’t think we’re quite seeing the same level of confidence in the markets ahead of this election but, still, it does appear we’re quite vulnerable." Asian share markets were moderately positive this morning, as were commodity prices, despite a relatively strong dollar. Copper on Monday crossed the $5,000 a tonne mark for first time since April. At 9am, the rand was at R13.4111 to the dollar from Monday’s R13.3652. It was at R14.8120 to the euro from R14.7578 and R16.6370 to the pound from R16.5662 The euro was at $1.1045, from $1.1042.
