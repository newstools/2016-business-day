SA Under-20 coach Thabo Senong says their upcoming friendly against Kenya will be good preparation for the weighty challenges ahead. Senong begins a camp with Amajita on November 20, when he hopes to have an injection of new players‚ including overseas-based Luther Singh (GAIS‚ Sweden)‚ Thabo Cele (Real Sport Clube‚ Portugal)‚ Liam Jordan (Sporting Lisbon‚ Portugal) and Zama Ramabuwane (Hapoel Ra’anana‚ Israel). It will be a final warm-up before the Cosafa Under-20 Championships in North West from December 7-16‚ and the African Youth Championships that will be staged in Zambia from February. Qualification for the 2017 Fifa Under-20 World Cup in South Korea will be up for grabs at that tournament. "It will be good preparation and a chance to integrate the new players‚" Senong said. "The short-term objective is to do well in the Cosafa tournament. "The medium-term plan is to qualify for the Under-20 World Cup by finishing in the top four at the African Championships in Zambia."
