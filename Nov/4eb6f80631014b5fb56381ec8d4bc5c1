After Wednesday’s and Thursday’s roller-coaster ride following Donald Trump’s shock US presidential election victory, relative calm returned to markets on Friday morning. The rand, which plunged 7% from R3.17/$ on Tuesday to R14.19/$ on Thursday, regained a little ground to R14.05/$ on Friday morning. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 which suffered a 5.36% "Trump slump" on Wednesday and then rebounded 6.72% on Thursday was flat ahead of the JSE’s opening on Friday morning. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 1% while mainland China’s Shanghai index was up 0.6%. A big question for investors is which sectors are likely to prosper or suffer when Trump becomes US president in January. Some punters have decided resources stocks will "win bigly" given Trump’s campaign promise to spend $500bn fixing US infrastructure, sending Glencore up 11.8% to R49.85, BHP Billiton up 7.07% to R238.43 and Anglo American up 6.5% to R210.93 on the JSE on Thursday. This ebullience continued on Friday morning, sending copper another 3.45% higher to $5,601/tonne on the London Metals Exchange. Trump’s victory has seen copper gain more than 12% in the past week, its biggest gain in five years. In Sydney, BHP Billiton was 1.5% higher at A$24.78 ahead of the JSE’s opening. Hospital owner Life Healthcare Group said in a trading statement on October 21 it expected to report on Friday that headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year to end-February grew by up to 11.2%. Basic earnings, however, fell by up to 19.4% due to a R370m impairment to account for a reduction of tariffs in its Polish hospitals.
