Cardiff &mdash; So where to from here for the Springboks?After an eighth defeat in 2016, ending November&rsquo;s northern hemisphere tour winless for the first time since 2002 was another addition to a growing list of embarrassments for South African rugby in 2016.Allister Coetzee&rsquo;s Boks played three Tests, losing 37-21 to England, 20-18 against Italy and 27-13 to Wales to rack up defeats six, seven and eight in the calendar year. They also drew 31-31 against a makeshift Barbarians team.This touring party was not even an impersonation of a Springbok team; it was a shallow facsimile of a once powerful former rugby collective.SA has been playing Test rugby for 125 years and there has never been a worse season.Since the historic indaba, Coetzee has spent the last month hammering home the message that SA rugby&rsquo;s structure is weak and the Springboks&rsquo; problems are the symptom of those weaknesses.But that does not exonerate him from his duty to develop a team and construct it on simple, time-honoured rugby basics.Defence, something for which Springbok teams have been revered for more than a century, was treated as a discipline that would take care of itself rather than a top priority. Three defence coaches over a period of 12 Tests underlines just how shambolic the preparation for the season was.None of those defence coaches Jacques Nienaber, Chean Roux and JP Ferreira are to blame. They hardly had time to do their work.Coetzee has complained he did not have time to prepare properly, given that he was officially appointed on April 11.It is a valid point, but then he should have prioritised the basics and prepared a team equipped with a water-tight defence and a limited gameplan to ensure better results.Not only did he not control the controllables, as sports people say, he never even identified what they were.If the Boks of 2016 had defended more competently, collectively and individually, results could, and would, have been different.In 12 Tests, they leaked 35 tries, which included nine against the All Blacks in Durban when they lost 57-15. It was the most tries per game (2.9) the Boks have conceded in a season in the professional era.In 452 Tests between 1891 and 2015, the Boks conceded 692 tries, or an average concession of 1.5 per Test. They have nearly doubled that rate this year and that is why, more than any other reason, they have lost 67% of their matches in 2016.Allowing opponents to breach the try-line heaped pressure on the Springboks.Losing to Ireland at home for the first time, when the tourists were down to 14 men for a major part of the match, was the first sign that this year was going to be a disaster.The crisis continued unabated through the Rugby Championship and smashed into a brick wall on the slate-grey fields of Europe in the past three weeks.All that is left now is for Coetzee to be shown the door and a new coach with a clear vision, plan and blueprint to start the process of rebuilding the image of Springbok rugby, to be strapped in.If the Boks team endure one more season of results like they did this year, they will be consigned to a permanent place among tier-two nations.
