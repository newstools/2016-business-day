The CEO of the Office of the Public Protector, Louisa Zonda, has resigned from her position, just months after being appointed. Public protector spokeswoman Kgalalelo Masibi confirmed on Wednesday that Zondo was leaving, and had cited “personal reasons” for her decision. She was not able to give further information. Newly appointed Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is currently in Durban attending a conference. “She will be serving notice throughout November. We wish her all of the best for the future,” Masibi said. The news emerged as President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday withdrew his application to interdict former public protector’s Thuli Madonsela’s state capture report. New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane recently told Parliament that there is low staff morale in the head office. With TMG Digital
