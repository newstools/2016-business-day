Bengaluru — Gold rose more than 1% on Monday, recovering from a nine-and-a-half-month low in the previous session, as the US dollar extended losses after touching a 14-year highs touched last week. "A slightly weaker US dollar saw gold prices recover some of the losses achieved earlier in the week. Buying also emerged as prices hit a key technical level," ANZ analysts said in a note. Spot gold was up 1.05% at $1,195.26/oz by 2.52am GMT. The metal marked its lowest since February 8 at $1,171.21/oz in the previous session. US gold futures rose 1.43% to $1,195.20/oz. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.76% at 100.720, after slipping 0.2% in the previous session, as US treasury yields eased from recent peaks. The metal has fallen about 7% so far in November due to a strong US dollar and surging bond yields as investors bet that US president-elect Donald Trump’s policies would spur growth and inflation. That further cemented the case for a near-term Federal Reserve interest rate hike, minutes from the Fed’s early November meeting showed. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold expensive for holders of other currencies, while higher interest rates could dent the appeal of nonyielding bullion. Gold was riding on the back of dollar weakness and support for the metal sat around $1,180/oz, while resistance comes in $1,200, MKS Pamp Group trader Sam Laughlin said. Traders also said supply concerns in China after a directive from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to limit gold import licences, kept premiums in Shanghai around $22, driven by buoyant demand. Gold premiums in top consumer China jumped to the highest in nearly three years last week on supply worries. Demand from South East Asia was also quite good and buying at lower prices could have driven prices higher, said Cameron Alexander, an analyst with Thomson Reuters-owned metals consultancy GFMS. SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.73% to 885.04 tonnes on Friday from 891.57 tonnes on Wednesday. Spot gold was expected to bounce to resistance at $1,210/oz as it has found support at $1,172, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver gained 1.6% to $16.75/oz and palladium rose 0.3% to $743.13 Platinum was up 1.77% at $919.00. Reuters
