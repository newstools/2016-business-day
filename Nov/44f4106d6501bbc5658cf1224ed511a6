&nbsp;Brindisa is a much-loved brand among Londoners who enjoy Spanish food. With five restaurants across the city, a shop and a thriving business importing Spanish products, it has made an enormous contribution to Spanish cuisine in the UK capital over the past 30 years.In her book Brindisa: The True Food of Spain, the owner of the company, Monika Linton, shares her encyclopaedic knowledge and recipes.Linton, 54, describes her journey from a childhood in Africa to university studies in Spanish, culminating in a teaching post outside Barcelona.She evokes memories of home-cooked meals prepared by Spanish mothers who "adopted" her into their families.Her life story is so interesting, and Linton is such a skilled storyteller, that one wishes the book could metamorphose into an autobiographical novel.History is a fascinating ingredient in Brindisa&rsquo;s success. Following Franco&rsquo;s death in 1975, the industrialised and standardised food production enforced during the fascist decades gave way to a return to the land and the re-emergence of artisan cheese and wine makers.Linton invested &pound;800 in a few Spanish cheeses, introduced these and other Spanish items to chefs in London and her business was born.Not only was she determined to expand the UK market for Spanish foods, but also to support the survival of small artisanal producers she located in the Spanish countryside.She transports readers to remote villages, gastronomy clubs and local restaurants, describing what she eats there and sharing the recipes.She introduces a remarkable cast of food artisans and craftspeople; farmers fanatically dedicated to rare breeds of sheep or heritage varieties of pulses.We meet olive oil producers, growers of capers, curers of fish and meat, and an engineer who left the city to craft Monte Enebro, one of the best cheeses in the world.Linton&rsquo;s background as a teacher shines through her detailed essays. While lengthy, they are illustrated with human stories and humorous anecdotes.Writing about the rice-producing regions of Spain, Linton describes a visit to a village restaurant in Murcia that served seafood, rabbit and chicken paella and where, between courses, a large group of elderly nuns sung hymns and danced around the tables.My favourite story is how Linton marinated a wild boar in a bath in Catalunya.The recipes are divided into chapters dealing with breakfast and snacks, tapas, big plates, pudding and cheese.Anything you ever needed to know about anchovies, rice, capers, cheese, pulses and many other Spanish ingredients has pages devoted to their provenance, variety, use and place in Spanish culture.With keen attention to detail, Linton provides fascinating information for those new to Spanish cuisine as well as people steeped in its culinary world. The recipes range from the simple, such as quince alioli, to the complex &mdash; baking an Ensaimada, a coiled pastry that is a speciality on the island of Majorca.The dishes in the book are regional and seasonal, often classic and sometimes contemporary, introducing readers to intriguing innovations. Granny Smith apples, for example, find a new life in apple gazpacho, Manchego cheese in ice cream.Some dishes are luxurious, such as the fisherman&rsquo;s stew made with lobster, monkfish and clams, but many use humble ingredients &mdash; chickpeas, grains, vegetables and fruit.Linton notes that vegetarianism is not as popular in Spain as in some other parts of the world. Vegetarians are considered to be people who like vegetables, rather than nonmeat or fish eaters. Yet the book contains a fair number of tempting dishes such as cigrons guisats a la Catalan (Catalan-style chickpeas with saffron and almond picada) or detailed instructions on how to make a proper tortilla de patatas, the potato omelette eaten everywhere in Spain.Linton may have started out as a teacher, but has long ago found her m&eacute;tier as entrepreneur, restaurateur, food advocate, promoter and protector of artisan food makers, and consummate raconteur.Often a new cookbook leaves me itching to get into the kitchen. Brindisa: The True Food of Spain does far more than that. Linton&rsquo;s stories have me hooked on the idea of a road trip, with her food recommendations and restaurant tips as my guide.Brindisa: The True Food of Spain Monika Linton Fourth Estate
