Cabinet is concerned at the increase in irregular expenditure by government departments and their entities, as shown in Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu&rsquo;s latest report, and is willing to take any measures necessary to improve financial controls.This is according to Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe during a briefing of the media on Thursday morning in Parliament on the Cabinet&rsquo;s meeting. Makwetu announced an almost 80% surge in irregular expenditure to more than R46bn.Radebe said while the 8% overall improvement in audit outcomes among departments and entities should not be ignored, failure to spend finances and procure by the book left the door open for conflicts of interest and rout.International credit ratings agencies are in the country this month to review SA&rsquo;s sovereign rating amid concerns that the country may be downgraded to junk later next month.Among many issues, they are expected to be looking at things such as irregular and wasteful expenditure. They are also going to be looking at governance in the country&rsquo;s parastatals and the prevailing political landscape."We are worried about the audit outcomes. We are taking measures to curb the impact of these audit outcomes and improve controls. There has been an improvement. Ministers are being called upon to ensure that these failings do not reoccur," Radebe said.MPs on Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts and the standing committee on the auditor-general offered their support to Makwetu in an effort to review the law to make his office&rsquo;s recommendations binding.Radebe said this conversation had not yet taken place at a Cabinet level but he pledged the Cabinet&rsquo;s support in efforts to improve the financial management and audit outcomes of the 484 auditees, including about 196 national and provincial departments as well as 315 public entities."We have not discussed the AG&rsquo;s [auditor-general&rsquo;s] powers as Cabinet. Any measure that will bring about the improvement of financial controls will be welcomed. The AG briefs us thoroughly as Cabinet and we need to go beyond the call of duty to heed what the auditor-general is saying," he said.In his report released on Wednesday, Makwetu said fruitless and wasteful expenditure in some departments had increased 14% in the three-year period, adding up to R1.37bn.Six of those entities audited, including the Passenger Rail Agency of SA, made up more than 70% of the fruitless and wasteful expenditure."Some departments lack the needed discipline to bring in proper finance controls and accurate disciplines of accounting &hellip;. A growing number of entities have come forward with their financial statements and are outstanding," Makwetu said.He attributed the high rate of irregular expenditure to a failure by government departments to adhere to supply chain management guidelines."The litany of these things creates doubt as to whether you procured these goods and services cost effectively. It could lead to a conflict of interest where people who work for the government could want to do business with the state and would want to take advantage."
