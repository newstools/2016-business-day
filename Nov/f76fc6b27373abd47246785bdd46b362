Eskom&rsquo;s refusal to provide energy-focused EE Publishers, with information about its generation capacity and electricity demand is being contested in the High Court in Pretoria.The information requested in June through an application under the Promotion of Access to Information Act (Paia) include data on the week-on-week energy availability factor, demand, net energy sent out and outage statistics, which EE Publishers argues is needed to analyse Eskom&rsquo;s performance.In particular the publisher wants the generation medium-term adequacy report for each week from April 25 to June 19."Eskom&rsquo;s failure to act transparently in providing such data prevents independent analysts and researchers from reviewing and understanding generation performance trends in SA, and enables Eskom to hide inefficiencies and present one-sided and misleading information to the public," the publisher&rsquo;s MD, Chris Yelland, said."Eskom has stonewalled EEPublishers, and refused to provide the information, without providing reasons for doing so. The information was previously made available on the utility&rsquo;s website for years, but is now no longer accessible."Eskom has given notice it intends to oppose the court application. Spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the reasons for Eskom&rsquo;s refusal would become clear in court.In his founding affidavit, EEPublishers assistant editor Jacobus Potgieter noted no response had been received to the Paia application despite requests and an appeal through further Paia procedure.The act deemed a lack of response and the failure to provide adequate reasons for not providing the requested information to be a refusal.The type of data EE Publishers sought "is made available by international electricity generation utilities and in broader and more granular detail" than the data made available by Eskom, Potgieter said.Yelland insisted the right to access to information from public bodies such as Eskom by the public and the media was a constitutional right. "Litigation was a last option to get the information requested. One can&rsquo;t imagine why Eskom would refuse access to this most basic generation performance data."Civilian anticorruption group Outa is assisting EE Publishers.
