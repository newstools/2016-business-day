The JSE is likely to follow oil down on Tuesday. Sasol closed 1.63% lower at R366 and Standard Bank’ s West Texas Intermediate price tracking exchange-traded closed 1.39% lower at R9.94 on Monday. West Texas Intermediate was trading at $46.8/barrel and Brent at $47.95/barrel on Tuesday morning ahead of a meeting of Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna. The lifting of sanctions against Iran has made it harder for other Opec members to curb oil supply, and falling prices indicated traders doubt this week’s meeting will result in an agreement. Falling oil prices saw most of the stock exchanges trading ahead of the JSE’s opening lose ground. Tokyo’s Nikkei 25 was down 0.33% and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.05%. Chemicals group Omnia said in a trading statement on November 18 it expected to report on Tuesday that basic and headline earnings per share for the six months to end-September declined by up to 25%. The South African Reserve Bank is scheduled to release money supply and private sector credit extension figures at 8am. Trading Economics forecasts money supply to have slowed to about 5% in October from 5.64% in September. Private sector credit extension is expected to have slowed to 6.6% in October from 7.19% in September. The RMB sponsored business confidence index done by Stellenbosch University’s Bureau of Economic Research is scheduled for release at 12pm. Trading Economics expects a drop to 42 points in the fourth quarter from 44 the previous quarter.
