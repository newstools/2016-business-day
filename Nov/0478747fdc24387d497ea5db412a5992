ANC MPs who missed the sitting of the National Assembly sitting on Tuesday and Wednesday without leave will face disciplinary proceedings and possible sanction, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said Thursday.The sitting was for the debate and adoption of the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.The MPs were absent despite having confirmed their compulsory attendance with the party, and despite desperate messages being sent to them during the session urging them to rush to the house to make up a quorum to pass the bill &mdash; which is critical for the funding of government programmes.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the National Assembly &ldquo;huffing and puffing&rdquo; when called but other MPs ignored the urgent pleas by Mthembu to come immediately to the house, he said at a media briefing on the issue.Mthembu said the names of the absentees &mdash; those who had not voted, which he would not disclose &mdash; would be sent &ldquo;swiftly&rdquo; to the ANC&rsquo;s caucus disciplinary committee chaired by Mothale Motshekga to face charges.Sanctions that the committee can apply included serious warnings and fines &mdash; and if the disciplinary committee believed it was warranted, it could refer the matter to the ANC national disciplinary committee for more serious sanction.Repeat offenders could be removed from Parliament by the national disciplinary committee.The ANC caucus decided unanimously on Thursday after a three-hour discussion on the matter that sanctions were called for.The caucus was of the view that the MPs&rsquo; absence was a sign of ill discipline in party ranks and that there must be consequences.EmbarrassmentThe National Assembly&rsquo;s failure to adopt the bill &mdash; which will be resubmitted for adoption next week &mdash; means its referral to the National Council of Provinces will be delayed. This might require the extension of the NCOP session for a week, incurring additional expense.The bill, tabled by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with the medium-term budget policy statement, is critical for the continued funding of government programmes. It provides for a R5.41bn adjustment to the budget.&ldquo;The failure to pass a draft legislation on two consecutive occasions is unprecedented and therefore requires the highest sanction,&rdquo; Mthembu said. It was also &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo;, he said.DA and EFF MPs walked out of the National Assembly prior to voting, exposing the ANC&rsquo;s lack of quorum.The opposition parties&rsquo; &ldquo;politically expedient&rdquo; tactic did not take the country forward, Mthembu said, and the DA would regret it if the ANC also adopted it in the metros and municipalities where the DA governed, such as Nelson Mandela Bay or Johannesburg.Mthembu said 209 ANC MPs had confirmed their attendance at the Wednesday sitting with an additional 40 having been granted leaves of absence. This gave the party confidence that the bill would be adopted.A total of 193 MPs voted for the bill on Wednesday with five votes against &mdash; three votes short of the 201 required for a quorum. It will now be submitted to the National Assembly again next week for adoption and Mthembu said no MP or minister would be given a leave of absence.&ldquo;The absence of these MPs, despite recorded confirmation that they would be present, is disgraceful and downright disrespectful to the people of SA. The unanimous view of the caucus is that the harshest punishment must be taken against the absentees.&ldquo;The public deserves representatives that take their parliamentary tasks seriously and demonstrate commitment to serve.&rdquo;Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said at a post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday that the failure to pass the bill was &ldquo;disappointing and a matter of great concern&rdquo; and was discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday.Radebe said the MPs were elected as representatives of the people and were accountable to them. &ldquo;It is very bad for Parliament not to be able to pass a budget,&rdquo; as this was required for government to undertake its programmes.DA finance spokesman David Maynier said Wednesday&rsquo;s failure for the second time to adopt the bill represented a &ldquo;humiliating defeat&rdquo; for the ruling party.&ldquo;What this proves is that the ANC is now so internally divided, so dysfunctional, so disinterested and so poorly disciplined that they are not even capable of getting the basics right, which is simply to show up and vote in Parliament,&rdquo; Maynier said.He said the DA did not support the bill believing that it provided for an &ldquo;unfair share&rdquo; of revenue between the national, provincial and municipal spheres of government.
