MPs have responded to auditor-general Kimi Makwetu&rsquo;s latest report on government departments and entities by supporting his calls for his office to be given teeth to enforce its recommendations."We need to investigate the powers of the AG," said Vincent Smith, chairman of the standing committee on the auditor-general."It&rsquo;s a Chapter 9 institution," he said."Even he [Makwetu] is complaining that he brings recommendations to the table and a year down the line there is no improvement on the same matters he raised a year before."Makwetu on Wednesday announced that irregular expenditure by government departments and parastatals soared to R46.36bn in the 2015-16 financial year, as a result of their failure to adhere to procurement guidelines.The Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) accounted for R13.9bn of that.The auditor-general&rsquo;s report covers assessments of 484 auditees, including 196 national and provincial departments and 315 public entities with a budget of R1.2-trillion.Makwetu said in some cases departments and parastatals that received unfavourable audit opinions did not have proper accounting systems in place to account adequately for their finances.The provincial governments with the highest number of clean audits were Gauteng (60%), the Western Cape (79%) and KwaZulu Natal (35%), while the Eastern Cape showed a marked improvement in audit outcomes.Smith said the relevant parliamentary committees had called departments and entities to discuss their irregular, unauthorised, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure.The government&rsquo;s Anti-corruption task team had also been asked to attend these meetings, he said.The standing committee on the auditor-general was helping the auditor-general&rsquo;s office with research on how to change the law to give the institution the teeth to enforce its recommendations.ScopaAlso on Wednesday, members of Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) took the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) and the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to task for failing to properly explain their irregular expenditure.Sanral appeared before the committee to brief it on irregular, unauthorised, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure at the agency.Sanral acknowledged to the committee that one of its employees had failed to declare a conflict of interest on three projects worth a combined R1.3m.Sanral also acknowledged that four bidders were awarded R39.5m worth of tenders without submitting original or certified black economic empowerment certificates.Committee member for the EFF Ntombovuyo Mente said all implicated parties needed to be pursued and Sanral should keep the committee updated on actions taken against those implicated.The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs told the committee that its irregular expenditure awaiting condonation grew from R550m in 2014-15 to more than R1bn in 2015-16.Scopa DA member Tim Brauteseth charged that the department&rsquo;s director-general, Muthothi Sigidi, had "dropped the ball".He said that what was concerning was that the implementing agents were not named. "Who are the implementing agents and what amounts are attached to the implementing agents in this regard?" he asked.Sigidi defended himself by saying that in the 2014-15 financial year the department had appointed implementing agents who had to recruit participants with whom they would work. He said these items did not fall directly under his responsibility.DA MP David Ross called on Scopa to thoroughly investigate the departments and entities with a view to recovering "every cent" lost to irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure.
