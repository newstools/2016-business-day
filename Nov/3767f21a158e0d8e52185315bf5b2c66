The South African business community got more pessimistic in the final quarter of 2016, a poll by Stellenbosch University’s Bureau of Economic Research (BER) released on Tuesday showed. The BER’s business confidence index fell four points to 38 from 42 index points in the third quarter, the RMB sponsored poll of 1,600 respondents found. SA’s low business confidence is often cited as a concern by credit ratings agencies. "Simply put, without a notable improvement in sentiment, the economy will remain stuck in first gear", Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) chief economist Ettienne le Roux said. Although South African businesspeople are more gloomy than they were three months ago, the reading is still higher than the 32 index points recorded six months ago in the second quarter survey. "The low point in the index may thus well be behind us," Le Roux said. The BER attributed the improvement in confidence in the third quarter to the hype surrounding the local elections. Building was the only sector to show increased optimism in the fourth quarter, with overall confidence of building contractors rising to 48 from 44. Confidence among retailers, which jumped from 26 points in the second quarter to 43 in the third quarter, fell back to 34 points as the peak Christmas shopping period approaches. "In addition to continued subdued growth in real household income, the application of new and stricter regulations for the granting of in-store credit also depressed sales volumes," BER said in its statement. Wholesalers remained fairly optimistic, with their business confidence index declining slightly to 53 from 56 points. Manufacturers remained at 30 points. "As for new vehicle dealerships, many longed for an improvement in sales during the fourth quarter. This failed to materialise. Consequently, their mood deteriorated anew, with more than seven out of every 10 dealerships now unhappy with prevailing business conditions," the statement said.
