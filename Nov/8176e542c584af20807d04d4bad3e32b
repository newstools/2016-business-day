Hobart &mdash; Australian captain Steve Smith has hit back at Graeme Smith&rsquo;s comments about his leadership.On Wednesday&sbquo; at the function in Sydney where he was made an honouree of the Bradman Foundation&sbquo; the former South African captain voiced opinions critical of Australian cricket in several aspects &mdash; among them Steve Smith&rsquo;s captaincy."You kind of think he&rsquo;s trying to figure a lot of stuff out at the moment&sbquo;" Graeme Smith said. "I certainly went through those phases in my career and you need to figure them out quickly."He&rsquo;s probably asking himself a lot of questions about style of play&sbquo; what type of leader he is&sbquo; what is the type of players that he wants to walk on to the field with," Graeme Smith said."But&sbquo; as a leader&sbquo; you need to understand that for yourself about who you are and that&rsquo;s the only time you can really get your team to play with that personality. I think he&rsquo;s trying to figure that all out at the moment. It certainly looks that way and he looks a bit lost."Smith&sbquo; who led SA to their only two Test series victories in Australia&sbquo; in 2008-09 and 2012-13&sbquo; and famously batted with a broken hand in a failed bid to save the Sydney Test in January 2009&sbquo; said the culture of Australian cricket was changing."If I think about earlier years it was always built on respect and the value of the baggy green&sbquo;" he said. "Maybe players didn&rsquo;t always get on but they respected the environment and they were traditional and they understood the importance of what playing for Australia meant."You kind of always got the feeling that there was a polarised sense in the Aussie team over the last few years and maybe Steve Smith has inherited that a little bit and he&rsquo;s trying to build again."Graeme Smith&rsquo;s opinions have been backed up by disclosures in autobiographies published by former Australian players Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson during SA&rsquo;s tour that detail rifts and divisions in the Aussie dressing room.But Steve Smith was having none of that on Thursday."I&rsquo;m not sure what Graeme Smith knows about Australian cricket&sbquo;" Steve Smith said. "I think the team&rsquo;s in a good place at the moment &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got a good culture built on constant improvement and getting better."We&rsquo;re a tight-knit group and we&rsquo;re ready to hopefully turn this around this week."Perhaps Steve Smith needs to look in the book &mdash; the scorebook that is&sbquo; not those featuring players&rsquo; ghosted scribblings.If he does he will be reminded that SA won the first Test at the WACA on Monday, despite being bowled out for 225&sbquo; losing Dale Steyn to injury early in Australia&rsquo;s reply&sbquo; and not taking a wicket in that innings until they had conceded 166 runs.That&rsquo;s how a tight-knit group plays.TMG Digital
