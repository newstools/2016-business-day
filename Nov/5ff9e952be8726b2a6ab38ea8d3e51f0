The rand was marginally softer against the dollar at midday on Tuesday due to subdued trade, as traders awaited the US presidential election. The rand erased some gains made on Monday during a relief rally fuelled by hopes that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would beat Republican rival Donald Trump. News that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) cleared Clinton over the use of a private e-mail server created risk-on trade in global markets and also supported the dollar. At 11.39am, the rand was at R13.4040 to the dollar from Mondayâ€™s R13.3652. It was at R14.8169 to the euro from R14.7578, and R16.6568 to the pound from R16.5662 The euro was at $1.1054, from $1.1042. The rand also gained on Monday after pushing aside reports at the weekend claiming that the National Prosecuting Authority was preparing fresh charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, CJS Securities analysts said.
