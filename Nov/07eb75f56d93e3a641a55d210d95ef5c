So Donald Trump will be the next occupant of the White House.Angry whites, predominantly blue collar, voters have responded to his populist messaging. Central to that messaging is the perceived misfortunes of industrial America, in a globalising world. As the Brexit vote showed, and as the rise of populism in Western Europe affirms, the politics of the old industrial west have now shifted decisively in the wake of the global financial crisis.These are sobering days for the world, and particularly for the fortunes of the global trade and investment system. Why?Consider the key contours of a potential Trump trade agenda, and the powers he will shortly exercise should he seek to deliver fully on his promises.Trade features centrally in Trump&rsquo;s economic plan. At the heart of the Trump ideology is a mercantilist view of the world, in which the US trade deficit is caused by "cheating" trading partners, and so the US, being the most powerful nation on earth, must use trade instruments to correct the perceived imbalances.On the cards, therefore, are high, across-the-board import tariff increases targeted at two trade "cheaters": China (45%), and Mexico (35%).China, Japan and Germany are singled out as currency manipulation "cheaters", the proposed remedy for which is countervailing import duties on their exports to the US.Canada and South Korea are fingered for benefiting unduly from their trade agreements with the US &ndash; Nafta and Korus respectively &ndash; which must be renegotiated and made more "equitable", or face a US withdrawal from the treaties.Just in case the US trade partners in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) object to any of this, the US will also withdraw from the WTO should the rest of the world get too uppity.And, obviously, the Trans Pacific Partnership, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, should now officially be considered dead unless by some miracle President Barack Obama can get the former through the looming "lame duck" session of Congress.RIP US leadership of the global trading system; enter from stage right the spectre of a global trade war, in a worldwide economic context of stagnant growth and major, unresolved imbalances in the financial system. This is more than shades of the 1930s.Would President Trump have the legal authority to implement such policies?US trade policy analysts note that he does, and that the full extent of his powers is actually far greater, and potentially far more damaging, than most people realise.Trump could draw from at least six statutes on the US legislative books, one dating back to 1917, without recourse to Congress, and likely with little push back from the US judicial system.Business groups are bound to challenge these trade policies but, if Trump sticks to them, probably to little avail.So, if President Trump enacts candidate Trump&rsquo;s agenda, the entire post-Second World War trade and investment institutional architecture would be at risk.This may please some &mdash; and with some justification given the system&rsquo;s numerous imbalances, such as agricultural subsidies, and those not just in the developed world.However, it is difficult to see how global trade disorder, and the rule of the mighty that would surely follow, is in anyone&rsquo;s interests, let alone the poor&rsquo;s.And that is before we consider the potential implications of Trump&rsquo;s foreign policy.He clearly has little respect for the cross-party foreign policy consensus built up over many decades since the Second World War, and may well seek to unravel it. This sentiment lies behind his repeated statements that US allies such as Japan and Germany (remember those "cheaters") must pay their "fair share" of maintaining the Western alliance system, and particularly Nato.To say the Japanese are concerned would be an understatement &mdash; during my visit to Tokyo in July this year, great concern was expressed about what Trump might do once in office. Recalibration must now be in full swing across the Asia-Pacific; a region already circling around a geopolitical knife-edge with the US and China at the centre of its axis of tension.Indeed, we may be witnessing an event of epochal proportions, signalling an end to the Western liberal international economic order as we know it.Again, this may please some, such as Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin, and perhaps a few of his Brics counterparts including elements of SA&rsquo;s foreign policy elite, but it definitely will not please all.For those, like myself, who recognise the enormous stability that the US leadership of the international system has brought over the past few decades, warts and all, this is indeed a brave new world we may be heading into.Perhaps President Trump will pull back from the brink of candidate Trump&rsquo;s agenda? Personally, I doubt it. He clearly believes in it, and now has his mandate. He is also patently not beholden to the liberal core of the now old Republican Party.So what does this mean for SA, and our trade relations with the US?First, should the darkest scenarios unfold, it is highly likely that global trade, investment, and growth will be seriously, and negatively, affected, and for years to come.This would probably tip SA into economic recession, which would undoubtedly worsen our already heated politics, and deepen our social crisis, while the secular stagnation that could ensue would offer little prospect of relief.Second, we would be bystanders in the ensuing "fight of the elephants". As the African proverbs go, the grass gets trampled, and it is better to stay out of the jungle.Third, I cannot see us staying out of the fray. Nor should we, where matters of principle concerning international trade governance are at stake.However, given these principled issues, and that on our side of the Atlantic the overt prejudices that Trump represents will poison the atmosphere, we are likely to be openly critical of the US.That country already regards us somewhat suspiciously in light of the ANC and its alliance partners&rsquo; foreign policy pronouncements, and this is likely to feed into a negative spiral of US recalibration of its trade relations with us, and vice versa.Fourth, the future of our bilateral trade relations with the US is already in balance, as the fracas last year over the renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) showed. Negative reinforcement along the lines I anticipate means our exit from Agoa is now almost certain.The only way to replace the ensuing loss of tariff preferences would be to negotiate a trade agreement with the US. However, SA is extremely unlikely to want to go that route given its own protectionist inclinations, while the US will also recalibrate its entire approach to trade agreements and so this may not be on offer.Therefore, the future of the bilateral trading relationship must now be very much in question.I can only see two silver linings in this otherwise gloomy, and admittedly preliminary, assessment.First, Trump and his entourage s protectionist instincts will resonate in SA. Who knows, that may provide some basis for reaching a deal. But that is a big stretch.Second, perhaps Trump will only serve one term. But right now, who would bet against him pulling another rabbit out of the hat, or of someone more populist than him taking his place?Fasten your seatbelts; we are in for a most interesting ride.
