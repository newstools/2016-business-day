The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) has become the third state-owned company to have a funding ban lifted by Futuregrowth Asset Management, three months after the latter froze lending."Following the suspension announcement two months ago, we have been proactively engaging with Futuregrowth to understand and address their concerns," DBSA CEO Patrick Dlamini said on Monday. "We are pleased that our relationship has been restored and strengthened."In August Futuregrowth froze funding worth R1.8bn to six state-owned companies, including power utility Eskom, lenders the Land Bank and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), and Transnet, citing concerns with corporate governance and loans awarded to politically exposed persons.The move came after the Cabinet decided to establish a presidential co-ordinating council for these companies.Futuregrowth has since lifted the funding freeze against the Land Bank and the IDC subject to conditions.The DBSA said Futuregrowth&rsquo;s due diligence had confirmed that it had an "appropriately constituted board" with the right mix of skills and experience, with a healthy relationship between it and the executive committee."We have committed to increasing reporting on board and investment activities as well as implementing additional governance structures that Futuregrowth has recommended," said Dlamini.
