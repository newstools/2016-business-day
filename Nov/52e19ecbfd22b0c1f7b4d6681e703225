The pound’s Brexit crash knocked UK-focused private equity group Brait’s net asset value (NAV) per share down 15% to R105.06 at September 30. Measured in pounds, Brait’s net asset value per share remained flat at £5.90, the company said in its interim results statement on Wednesday morning. The value of Brait’s 79.9% stake in UK clothing chain New Look plunged 42% to R18.7bn at September 30 from R32.4bn the previous year, it said. "The UK clothing and apparel sector remains challenging as a result of continued unseasonal weather through autumn, declining UK consumer confidence and reduced footfall," Brait said. New Look’s share of the British women’s clothing market shrank to 5.9% from 6.4%. "The decline in market share is due, in part, to launching spring and summer and then autumn clothing too early as the weather was unseasonably cool and unseasonably warm, respectively, during these transitional periods," the statement said. Brait raised its stake in UK grocery chain Iceland Foods from 18.7% to 57.1%, boosting the value of its holding fourfold to R7.7bn. "As most of Iceland’s inputs are pound denominated, with only 7% of its suppliers based in Europe, its direct exposure to pound weakness is relatively low," Brait said. The value of Brait’s 70.5% share in Virgin Active declined 1.2% to R16.1bn. The gym chain increased its outlets by eight to 247 while its membership remained flat at 1.2-million. Seven of the new clubs were opened in SA, and one in Thailand. The value of Brait’s 91.4% holding in local fast moving consumer goods group Premier grew 37.5% to R13.5bn over the year. Premier’s revenue grew 27% in its financial year to end-June, Brait said.
