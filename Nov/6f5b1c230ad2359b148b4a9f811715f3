One of the great things about people is their ability to adapt and to be inventive when confronted with a problem, even theoretical ones like the awful doom that awaits us as the climate changes or &mdash; OMG &mdash; the world is running out of oil and gas to provide the fuel needed for a comfortable life.Nuclear energy causes needless sleepless nights and there is no shortage of gas or oil. Wind and solar power, biogas and biofuels are good replacements, should all the gas and oil mysteriously evaporate.And, just in case that all runs out, Californian scientists have come up with a new(ish) solution: using human faeces.There is so much of the stuff in the US (don&rsquo;t laugh, most countries generate millions of tonnes of it) that scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, have designed a method of converting it to a fuel that can power engines.Annual US production of such waste is estimated at more than 1-billion tonnes. It is made up of the excretions of humans and other mammals. It is a big problem because, according to green theory, a lot of it generates methane, which is supposed to be the worst climate-affecting gas of them all.Enter human ingenuity.In addition to working with farm manure, the scientists included other agricultural waste, sewage from towns and cities and anything cellulose. They even took carbon dioxide out of the air.Extracting flammable gas from such sources is hardly unknown. But they all share the same problem: they are not very good for giving the oomph we get from petroleum-based fuels like petrol and diesel.Biofuels like ethanol don&rsquo;t really cut it. It corrodes metal pipes, which means just about everything in the transport sector has to be modified, from cars and trucks to fuel tankers and storage tanks.The Californian scientists have genetically modified a common bacterium called bacillus subtilis so it becomes better at breaking down the proteins in human faeces as well as doing a better job on algae.Everything left over from making wine, ethanol and beer can go directly into a fuel that can be used in ordinary internal combustion engines.Maybe in future when petrol-heads say their cars go like s**t off a shovel, it will be true rather than optimistic. All because of a tiny, (almost natural) bacterium.There will be a great demand from farmers living off the grid. Hippies will probably lead the way.&nbsp;
