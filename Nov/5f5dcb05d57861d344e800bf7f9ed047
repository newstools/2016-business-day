Sun City &mdash; Always short of an invite&sbquo; long-distance and long-time admirer of the Nedbank Golf Challenge Alex Noren surged to the title after a blistering final-round 63 here on Sunday."I watched this tournament on TV a lot growing up and it was always a tournament I wanted to get into, and eventually I did&sbquo;" the 34-year-old from Sweden said.He had to shoot low on Sunday to overhaul South Korea&rsquo;s Jeunghun Wang who held a six-shot advantage over him at the start of the day.Noren became the first player since Sergio Garcia in 2001 to come successfully from six back after the third round."I didn&rsquo;t think I had a chance from six shots back. I wanted to get a good round in and get a good feel for next week. Maybe work on my swing. I thought going under par would be a great score. My putter was hot."Noren needed a low round to overturn the deficit to third-round leader Wang. He shot 63 for a tournament score of 14 under par to run away with the title that seemed out of reach when Wang went two under for the day on the fourth hole.Noren fired eight birdies and an eagle to snatch the $1.16m first prize and move inside the top 10 (ninth) in the world rankings.He has now captured the Scottish Open&sbquo; the European Masters&sbquo; British Masters and the Challenge in the space of 11 events, which is remarkable considering it took him 214 tournaments to win his first four.Wang&rsquo;s round unravelled on the back nine, bogeying 13&sbquo; 15&sbquo; 16 and 18, but he held on to second place on eight under.SA&rsquo;s Branden Grace&sbquo; England&rsquo;s Andy Sullivan&sbquo; France&rsquo;s Victor Dubuisson&sbquo; Portugal&rsquo;s Ricardo Gouveia and Spain&rsquo;s Alejandro Canizares finished seven under.Noren&sbquo; the second-round leader, birdied the first three holes and picked up another on the fifth. That still left him four shots adrift of Wang.Wang, who birdied the fourth but relinquished a shot to par on the fifth, double bogeyed the eighth.Earlier on the same hole Noren birdied before he eagled the 10th and birdied the 11th. That effectively left him nine under for the round after 11 holes.Noren had to settle for bogey on the 14th, his only blemish.He played himself into contention for the Race to Dubai but Henrik Stenson still leads those standings with Danny Willett (second) and Rory McIlroy (fourth) capable of lifting the crown.TMG Digital
