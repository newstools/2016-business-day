Nearly one in three of the active leases entered into by the Department of Public Works (DPW is under investigation by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU). The DA said this was revealed in a reply to parliamentary question by Justice Minister Michael Masutha, showing that 649 out of 2,176 active "are under investigation". He said investigators were looking into leases that might not be "fair‚ competitive‚ transparent‚ equitable or cost-effective". "The department’s claim that there was not enough money for it to carry out its mandate can no longer be accepted until the large number of irregular leases are either corrected or relinquished by the DPW‚" the DA said. "The DA will be submitting parliamentary questions to ascertain how much these 649 leases‚ currently under investigation‚ are costing the department." The party said it would ask Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi "for an explanation as to why Mthatha in the Eastern Cape‚ with 27 irregular leases‚ was listed separately to the province‚ which had the highest number of irregular leases under investigation (142). "Mthatha falls within the Eastern Cape and we will request the reasoning behind the separate listing as it may be an attempt to deflate the high number of leases in the Eastern Cape‚" the DA said. "We will fight to ensure that the minister of public works and his department are held accountable if the findings of the SIU show negligence and disregard for proper procedure and judicious government." Masutha’s reply indicated investigations are expected to be completed only in March 2018. To be completed then, said Masutha‚ was an investigation into "the refurbishment of ministerial homes in and around Cape Town at allegedly vastly inflated costs".
