In September, it told Parliament it made a R4.67bn loss in its 2015 financial year.Lees told Fin24 he was pleased the reports had finally been tabled "after many years of secrecy"."The tabling of these reports comes after the matter was initially raised by the DA in Parliament some two-and-a-half months ago," he said."Despite a commitment at that time from Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that Mango and other SAA subsidiaries&rsquo; reports would be tabled, they were not tabled with the SAA annual reports," said Lees.SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni handed the state-owned airline&rsquo;s long-delayed 2015 and 2016 financial results, including figures for its subsidiaries, to the Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday.Fin24 said it had obtained a copy of Mango&rsquo;s results for the year to end-March which showed it made a R37m loss.Mango&rsquo;s loss in its most recent financial year followed profits of R38m in 2015 and R40m in 2014, according to Fin24.SAA&rsquo;s board is scheduled to appear in Parliament on Wednesday to give a progress report on turning around loss-making national carrier.&nbsp;
