High inflation and a volatile rand are unlikely to sway the Reserve Bank into hiking interest rates when its monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next week, according to economists who spoke to Business Day.The uncertainty brought on by Donald Trump s election in the US and the volatility this has unleashed on emerging-market currencies may be a deciding factor. This is instead of expectations that inflation could range between 6.2%-6.4% for October, breaching the Bank s 3%-6% target band.Nedbank economist Busisiwe Radebe said: "The important thing in their mind [MPC] right now would be what is happening with the currency and what is going to happen with the currency. The currency is pretty volatile at the moment."The rand declined more than 8% against the dollar in the past week, but staged a modest recovery on Tuesday.Rand movement is an important factor when the MPC makes a rates decision.Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan said: "We would expect the rand to depreciate substantially from current levels to prompt them [the Bank] to hike [interest rates]. On a year-to-date basis, the trade-weighted rand has still appreciated."The Bank has hiked rates to counter inflation stoked by rand depreciation, but uncertainty over Trump s presidency will make it a tough call for the MPC when it meets next Thursday.The US Federal Reserve could hike interest rates in December. Should this happen, the rand will be affected.The prospect of a credit ratings downgrade also looms for SA, which will have a bearing on the rand.Radebe said: "This time they [Reserve Bank] will take a wait-and-see approach."Interest rates have remained unchanged since the cumulative 75 basis points rise in the first quarter of 2016, despite inflation edging to 6.1% in September.MMI Holdings expected inflation to touch 6.2% year on year for October.Sanisha Packirisamy, an economist at Momentum Investments, said: "Food inflation is still likely to play a big role, but it is expected to come off sharply next year as better weather leads to a higher maize output, lowering prices." But it would be too soon for the Bank to cut rates, she said.Radebe said a 25 basis points interest rate hike was expected in early 2017.Inflation has also affected house prices.Jacques du Toit of Absa Home Loans said: "Real house price trends will be affected by consumer price inflation."
