The controversial contract between the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and Lekgotla Trifecta Collections (LTC) to collect billions of rand in taxpayer debt has been suspended.SARS approached the High Court in Pretoria to have the contract set aside after LTC failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest between its director Nhlamulo Ndhlela and SARS commissioner Tom Moyane. Ndhlela is Moyane&rsquo;s nephew.While SARS itself approached the court to terminate the contract, the high court decision could further embarrass it as it provided proof its systems were not tight enough to pick up such irregularities.It is an indictment on Moyane&rsquo;s leadership of the revenue service. This coming after the suspension of the tax agency&rsquo;s second in charge, Jonas Makwakwa for suspicious payments and transactions flowing into his personal bank account and that of his partner Kelly-Ann Elskie, who works for SARS.SARS said the North Gauteng High Court had suspended any further debt collection by LTC in terms of its agreements with the agency. In its urgent application, SARS said it sought to interdict LTC from performing any services under the master service agreement and service request agreement entered into between the two.LTC opposed the application.It was ordered that from November 18, LTC was not allowed to take any further steps to implement the agreements.The court also ordered LTC to return all confidential taxpayer information to SARS."The successful outcome of today s urgent high court proceedings is in the best interest of the public and underscores SARS dedication to the rule of law," it said.The tax agency was continuing with an application to set aside LTC s appointment to its panel of debt-collection service providers.The link between Ndhlela and Moyane emerged in a in July report in the Mail &amp; Guardian, which indicated that Ndhlela was granted the debt collection contract with an estimated fee of about 10% or up to R220m.At the time, SARS said Moyane was not aware his nephew was a shareholder in LTC.After the disclosures, SARS disputed that the fee was 10% or up to R220m, saying each of the three service providers were given R2.2bn debt to collect with an agreed commission of a mere 3.88% plus value-added tax of actual debt collected by them.The agency at the time denied any knowledge of the link between Ndhlela and Moyane, and said that once made aware via the media reports, a process had been initiated to cancel the contract.SARS also acted against Makwakwa after the suspicious payments were exposed in media reports. But the tax agency is said to have been sitting on the report detailing these transactions from the Financial Intelligence Centre since May.Makwaka remains on suspension, while law firm Hogan Lovells conducts an investigation into the matter.
