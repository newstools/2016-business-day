The Constitutional Court on Monday night refused the DA direct access to challenge the constitutionality of a state decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The court said it was not in the interests of justice for it to hear the matter at this stage. "The Constitutional Court has considered the application by the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution founded on exclusive jurisdiction should be dismissed as the matter does not invoke the jurisdiction of that court," a statement from the justice department said. Its decision means the opposition parties will have to go up the hierarchy of courts in their bid to stop the withdrawal â€” an option that could take long and may be heard after the fact. "Withdrawing from the ICC would require the National Assembly, to repeal the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act 27 of 2002 ("Implementation Act"), which incorporates the Rome Statute into domestic law," the DA had said in its application.
