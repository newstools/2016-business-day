Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula branded Sunette Viljoen, the country’s Olympic javelin silver medallist, as "arrogant and thankless" in a spat on Monday over cash bonuses. Mbalula and Viljoen exchanged insults on Twitter in which the minister has been accused of breaking a promise to pay R70,000 to silver medal winners at the Rio Games. Sunette Viljoen "is the most arrogant and thankless person … I’ve ever met", Mbalula said in a series of tweets. "What was due to her was payed [sic]. "[She] declared for all to kno[w] she doesn’t want the money … now she needs the money I must jump." Viljoen earlier tweeted direct messages from Mbalula in which he had written: "You said you don’t need it. So I stick with your wishes." The athlete replied saying she had "never, ever uttered these words. This is how you are treated for winning an Olympic medal. What a disgrace." The South African Olympic committee paid bonuses to successful Olympians. Mbalula announced additional bonuses upon greeting the team in August. AFP
