When SA experiences sudden surges in capital inflows or capital outflows, we tend to focus mainly on the effect this has on the rand exchange rate.Then if the rand appreciates or depreciates, we might go on to project what this might mean for the inflation outlook and whether it might change the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s next monetary policy decision.The piece of the puzzle that markets and media seldom consider &mdash; and probably just as well &mdash; is the effect these huge washes of capital can have on SA&rsquo;s financial system.In fact, the frequent turnarounds in capital flows of recent years, in incidents such as the 2013 "taper tantrum" or our own 9/12 Nenegate disaster last year, seem to have caused little indigestion to banks, bourses, insurers or fund managers.But they are examples of the kinds of risk to financial stability the Bank manages as part of its mandate, which for some years now has included not only price stability, but also financial stability. That&rsquo;s really about monitoring and managing the risks to the system as a whole, rather than supervising the soundness of individual banks, as the Bank does in its role as banking regulator &mdash; a role that will expand once the Twin Peaks system comes in, giving the Bank oversight over the prudence and soundness of all SA&rsquo;s financial institutions.As prudential regulator, it will watch individual banks. But in its role as financial stability regulator, it will look out for risks, global and domestic, to the system &mdash; as central banks everywhere are doing now.The global financial crisis of 2008/09 made it clear that financial instability was easily as much of a threat to economic growth and prosperity as the price instability caused by inflation &mdash; or deflation. Indeed, the global economy has yet to recover from the ravages to the financial systems of advanced countries that began with the subprime crisis.Since then, central banks have taken financial stability very seriously and our own central bank participates in the global bodies that oversee financial stability and has worked hard to ensure its approach, structures and standards are in line with global norms.This week, it published for comment a new discussion document on "A new macro-prudential policy framework for SA", which sets out a more formal and detailed framework for executing its financial stability policy mandate than it has had in place until now, defining the structure, objectives and decision-making process.SA&rsquo;s financial institutions are already heavily regulated and the burden grows with every passing year, yet it is very much in their interests to engage with the new document and ensure the Bank exercises its mandate in a way that allows financial industry players to grow, innovate and thrive, while at the same time minimising the risks of this to the economy.The Bank, commendably, has now added two financial stability forums a year to the monetary policy forums it has held since the 1990s, in an effort to encourage all stakeholders to have their say.It concluded in the Financial Stability Review, released this week, that despite the "headwinds" during the past six months, SA&rsquo;s financial system has remained robust, with well capitalised, liquid and profitable financial institutions.But the list of global and local risks is long and frightening. Donald Trump&rsquo;s shock election as US president will no doubt add to a list that already ranges from Brexit to China&rsquo;s growth prospects to US monetary policy and emerging-market capital outflows, through to SA&rsquo;s own idiosyncratic risks &mdash; the prospect of a ratings downgrade high among them.It&rsquo;s good to hear the Bank considers a downgrade "unlikely" &mdash; but it is equally good to know it is watching out carefully for any trouble.
