Consumer inflation moved further outside the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s 3%-6% target range in October, as some economists had expected.The consumer price index increased 6.4% in October from a year earlier, Statistics SA said on Wednesday, after the 6.1% increase reported last month for September.Forecasts varied, with some economists calling for a rise of has high as 6.4%. The Bloomberg consensus was for a forecast of 6.2% and Trading Economics put it at 6.1%.The Reserve Bank announces its monetary policy committee&rsquo;s decision on interest rates on Thursday, but it looks at inflation expectations for the next six months in its deliberations, so the CPI increase is unlikely to affect its decision.At previous meetings the Bank has said that although consumer inflation has consistently been higher than the target for most of this year, it seemed stable at those levels.The Bank is widely expected to leave the repo rate at 7%, with achingly slow local economic growth expected to outweigh international considerations such as a high probability that the US Federal Reserve will increase rates when it meets in two weeks&rsquo; time.Higher US interest rates are an incentive for investors to favour the dollar over the much riskier rand, as they lower the premium earned from holding rand compared with dollars. A weaker rand is an inflationary risk.&nbsp;
