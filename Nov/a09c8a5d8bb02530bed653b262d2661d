THE world&rsquo;s first HIV vaccine efficacy study to launch in seven years began at South African research sites on Wednesday&sbquo; ahead of World Aids Day.The study&sbquo; called HVTN 702&sbquo; will determine whether an experimental vaccine regimen safely prevents HIV infection among South African adults.About 5,400 men and women who are all HIV-negative have been enrolled in the programme.With more than 1,000 people in SA becoming infected with HIV each day&sbquo; a successful vaccine is seen as key to ending the epidemic.Prof Gita Ramjee&sbquo; director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the Medical Research Council&sbquo; said the launch was momentous for SA.Two participants were expected to receive the vaccine at the Vernham research site outside Durban on Wednesday morning.According to Ramjee&sbquo; if the HVTN 702 is shown to be effective against new infections&sbquo; this South African trial could lead to the licensing of the world&rsquo;s first HIV vaccine.TMG Digital/The Times
