As Gauteng braces for more heavy rain after Wednesday&rsquo;s deadly flash flood, the Johannesburg Roads Agency has countered criticism that the flooding was due to blocked stormwater drains.MD Sean Phillips said on Thursday that stormwater drains were cleaned regularly and maintained&sbquo; and blamed the flooding&sbquo; which left at least six people dead&sbquo; on "extreme rains".He told Radio 702 that Wednesday&rsquo;s rainfall was "unusual" and that the system had been "overflooded".It could not be designed to deal with the type of "one-in-50&sbquo; one-in-100-year" storm that occurred on Wednesday, he said.&nbsp;The city s Twitter account said: "Flash floods affect low lying areas even dams or river banks may break down suddenly."Roads in Johannesburg Ekurhuleni and Tshwane were obstructed on Thursday morning after being covered in mud and debris while residents across the province cleared out flooded homes.Passengers faced possible delays at OR Tambo International Airport for a second day. Flights were cancelled because of the weather on Wednesday and sections of the building and access roads around the airport were flooded.Adding to the airport s woes was a section of collapsed perimeter wall on its southern reach.The inclement weather seems set to stay for the week with a 60% chance of heavy rains forecast until Friday.TMG Digital
