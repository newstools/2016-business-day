SABC journalists facing death threats are pushing on with a Constitutional Court case challenging the broadcaster&rsquo;s controversial editorial policy.Aslam Moosajee of Norton Rose Fulbright, their lawyer, said on Sunday the matter was pending and confirmed some of his clients were being threatened. "There was argument filed about whether the court should grant my clients direct access and we are now waiting for a determination from the court on whether they should be granted direct access."The journalists, known as the SABC Eight, were fired earlier in 2016 for challenging a blanket ban on covering violent protests. They challenged their employer in the Labour Court and were reinstated, except Vuyo Mvoko, who is a freelancer.Moosajee said only some of the journalists had been threatened and this had been reported to the police. The SABC&rsquo;s attorneys had also been made aware of the situation.Suna Venter, Busisiwe Ntuli and Foete Krige have reportedly been subjected to intimidation and threatening SMSes.SABC economics editor Thandeka Gqubule said on Sunday what was happening was nerve-wracking. However, the group of journalists had decided they would continue going to work at the public broadcaster."It means something very specific about the state we have come to live in. That s what is concerning us and we are disturbed," she said."We made that decision upfront that, no matter what, we come to work and we are on point at work. We do our work diligently no matter what."The DA said on Sunday it would be writing to acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane requesting that the journalists be given police protection until the Constitutional Court case was finalised.The opposition party has approached the Western Cape High Court in another bid to have controversial former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng removed from the SABC. The matter is expected to be heard on November 23 and 24.The National Assembly last week unanimously adopted a motion to establish an ad hoc committee to institute an inquiry into the SABC board members fitness to hold office.Two board members resigned in protest against the reappointment of Motsoeneng as group executive of corporate affairs, effectively rendering the board a lame duck.
