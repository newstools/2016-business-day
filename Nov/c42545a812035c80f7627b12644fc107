"President Jacob Zuma is feeling quite sensitive about this campaign and about its potential to mobilise literally hundreds and thousands of people‚" one of the organisers of Save SA boasted on Thursday morning. Section27’s Mark Heywood said the ANC "itself seems very sensitive" to it too‚ and said the issue of "Jacob Zuma and calls for him to be step down" would be on the agenda of the ruling party’s national executive committee meeting, which starts on Friday. Heywood‚ however‚ stressed to Radio 702 that the Save SA campaign was not "an attack on the ANC; this is a question‚ it is an attack‚ a legal attack‚ a democratic attack on the president". He said: "We know that there are many‚ many ANC leaders and ordinary members who are deeply unhappy. And we will keep on calling out to those people‚ and say to them‚ ‘If you believe in the Constitution‚ if you value your own conscience‚ there will come a point where you have to stand up for this country and its people.’ "We’ll keep knocking on those doors and keep knocking on those consciences until people feel so uncomfortable or so emboldened that they do the right thing." Heywood said Save SA had the phone numbers of every MP and supporters would be encouraged to phone their representatives and question them on their stance on the leadership of the country. He said the campaign was not a "gimmick" or "flash in the pan"‚ but it hoped to "engineer discussions about our democracy‚ about our rights‚ about the type of politician that should run this country". The ultimate aim was the "People’s Motion of No Confidence against President Jacob Zuma". Save SA hoped to meet with the speaker of the National Assembly ahead of next February’s state of the nation address to facilitate the "people’s motion being tabled"‚ said Heywood. TMG Digital
