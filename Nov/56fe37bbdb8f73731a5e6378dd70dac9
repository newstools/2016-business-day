This [includes] 1.2-million learners at no-fee schools&sbquo; 42,000 learners in special schools and 141,000 ... grade R learners&sbquo;" she said.Provincial government will spend R600m on bursaries&sbquo; learnerships and internships&sbquo; which will benefit thousands of learners&sbquo; particularly from poor families&sbquo; across the province.The provincial government will also spend R127.2bn on health over the next three years.Creecy said the third key area of priority in government&rsquo;s expenditure in the coming years would be infrastructure&sbquo; which was important to improve service delivery in communities and create much-needed jobs."In this regard&sbquo; the Gauteng Infrastructure Financing Agency will over the 2017 MTEF [medium term expenditure framework] period have a project pipeline with a potential to raise more than R40bn to support the provincial infrastructure master plan&sbquo;" Creecy said.She said she was pleased that the province had managed to intensify cost-containment measures and&sbquo; over the past two budget cycles&sbquo; had diverted almost R500m from noncore spending towards priority programmes.Other highlights of the budget include:&bull; The department of co-operative government and traditional affairs has been allocated R20m to address the resettlement needs of communities that are affected by recent floods in the province.
