Bengaluru &mdash; Gold remained volatile in Asian trade on Friday, but looked set for its first weekly decline in four, with investors continuing to mull the economic outlook after Donald Trump won this week&rsquo;s US presidential election.Spot gold was at $1,260.12/oz at 2.51am GMT, near Thursday&rsquo;s close, while US gold futures were down 0.6% at $1,259.30/oz. Spot gold was set to end the week down 3.6%. The dollar hovered at a three-and-a-half-month high versus the yen early on Friday, extending big overnight gains as markets prepared for a Trump presidency that could stimulate the US economy fiscally and lift interest rates."The stronger US dollar and a more conciliatory tone from Trump continues to weigh on investor demand," ANZ analysts noted.The latest US jobs data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly if Washington used lower taxes or higher spending to boost economic growth, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday.
