The South African bond market steadied on Wednesday morning, reflecting a similar mood on global markets. The yield on the R186 bond edged up to 9.100% in early trade, from 9.060% on Tuesday. The bond market has sold off fairly sharply recently on the expectation of sharp US interest rate increases after Donald Trump swept to victory in the US presidential polls. "Event risk remains high around the US-led global uncertainty and locally we are still in murky waters on the political front," Sasfin Securities’ head of fixed-income dealing, Ashley Dickinson, said. "Despite the market looking relatively cheap and oversold I don’t think investors will be overly aggressive buyers just yet, but there will be a fundamental case to look for entry levels above 9.25% on the benchmark note." The US 10-year note, which is at the centre of market focus, stabilised at 2.2625% on Wednesday morning from 2.2623% on Tuesday.
