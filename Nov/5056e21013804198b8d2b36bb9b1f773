They are both left-handed, they both open the batting, and they both take more than their fair share of defiance onto the field. At least, Graeme Smith used to before his retirement in 2014. Dean Elgar is still at it, currently on SA’s tour to Australia. And the Aussies have noticed, not least because Elgar spent almost eight hours scoring 127 in the second innings of the first Test at the Waca, where SA won by 177 runs on Monday. "Most of them play their shots," Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood said on Thursday in discussing SA’s batsmen. "Except for Dean Elgar. He’s a bit of a grinder and very patient." Which, of course, Elgar took as a compliment. "That’s just my nature, to try and irritate the opposition," Elgar said on Thursday. "I’m not practising it. It just comes naturally. But if that’s the way they feel about it, it’s not a bad thing. "It’s maybe an objective I’ve achieved in the last Test and it’s going to be something to work on more going into the second and then possibly the third." In other words, get used to it, Hazlewood and company.
