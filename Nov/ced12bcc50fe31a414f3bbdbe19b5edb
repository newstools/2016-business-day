The State of Capture report is the property of the office of the public protector "as an institution" and any questions about it should be directed there, Busisiwe Mkhwebane said in a statement on Thursday night. "If members of the media need any information about the report‚ including how it was released and how the investigation was done‚ the office has the ‘institutional memory’ to explain all of that. "I took over the office with all its successes and failures. That is why I went to Parliament to present an annual report that was not prepared by me." Her office said she was happy to receive specific questions on anything to do with the report and the investigation that preceded it. Former public protector Thuli Madonsela said‚ just after Mkhwebane was quizzed on her report in Parliament two weeks ago‚ that: "Firstly‚ it was unfair on her to be expected to defend someone else’s report." The High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday ordered Mkhwebane to release the report before 5pm the same day. This came after President Jacob Zuma withdrew his application to interdict the release of the report. The report implicates senior government officials and their relationship with the influential Gupta family. Among them are Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen‚ Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane‚ Eskom CE Brian Molefe and President Jacob Zuma’s son‚ Duduzane.
