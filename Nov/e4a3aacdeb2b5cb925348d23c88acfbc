Singapore &mdash; Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday, as the market refocused on a persistent fuel supply overhang that is not expected to abate unless oil cartel Opec and other producers make a significant cut to their output.International Brent crude oil futures were trading at $45.74 a barrel at 4.45am GMT, down 10c, or 0.2%, from their last close.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were trading at $44.51 a barrel, down 15c, or 0.3%, from their last settlement, with a stronger dollar also weighing on prices.Traders said that an ongoing crude and refined product supply overhang that has dogged markets for more than two years was weighing on markets."Crude oil prices fell as the focus returned to supply growth. The IEA [International Energy Agency] suggested prices may continue to retreat amid relentless supply growth unless Opec makes significant supply cuts," ANZ bank said on Friday.The supply overhang could run into a third year in 2017 without an output cut from Opec, while escalating production from other exporters could lead to relentless supply growth, the IEA said on Thursday.In its monthly oil market report, the group said global supply rose by 800,000 barrels a day in October to 97.8-million barrels a day, led by record Opec output and rising production from non-Opec members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.In Africa, Nigeria is working out new oil and gas policies to attract more private investors and boost crude production by 500,000 barrels a day by 2020, state firm NNPC said on Thursday.The IEA kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2-million barrels a day and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8-million barrels a day in 2015.Beyond oversupply, a surging dollar following the initial shock of Donald Trump&rsquo;s US presidential election win also put pressure on prices, traders said.Because oil and refined products are traded in dollars, its import costs rise for any country using other currencies at home, potentially crimping demand.Reuters
