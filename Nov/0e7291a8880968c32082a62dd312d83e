Mark Pamensky, the Eskom director most directly linked to the Gupta family, has resigned from the board, Public Enterprises minister Lynne Brown said on Tuesday evening.Pamensky, who is also a director of telecoms company Blue Label as well as of the Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources, was among those subpoenaed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela for the State of Capture report.Pamensky&rsquo;s resignation follows that of Eskom CE Brian Molefe on Friday, who is to step down on January 1.The report found that the Eskom board was "improperly appointed" and did not conform to ethical standards as the directors or their immediate family members have multiple relationships with the Gupta family.Madonsela also criticised Brown for not acting to rectify this once the conflicts were pointed out in the media.Brown has said she sees no reason for the board to step down until a judicial commission into state capture completes its work.In a statement on Tuesday evening she said: "After careful consideration, I have accepted Mr Pamensky&rsquo;s resignation. He made an invaluable contribution over the past year to Eskom."I want to thank Mr Pamensky for his contribution to Eskom and wish him well."With this resignation, the Eskom board would require additional nonexecutive directors to address vacancies on the board."I intend submitting my recommendations to Cabinet soon and strengthen the board to ensure that the trend we have seen from Eskom&rsquo;s mid-term results continues."The appointment of a replacement for Molefe as well as additional appointments to the board will come under intense public scrutiny, given the observations by Madonsela that Eskom had gone to enormous lengths to assist the Guptas in the purchase of Optimum coal mine.
