One gets the impression Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba just might not mind if there was a little more of the rain that has swept the country on Saturday afternoon when Bafana Bafana meet Senegal in their World Cup qualifier at 3pm.The South Africans trained in a steady rain in their final session on the perfect&sbquo; beautifully green pitch at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday morning.By the afternoon when Senegal ran out&sbquo; the weather had cleared.Most of Senegal&rsquo;s players are based in Europe&sbquo; so will be used to far more adverse weather conditions than what Polokwane has to offer.And of course&sbquo; it rains in the west African country.But cool&sbquo; overcast conditions and even a bit of rain might suit 62nd-ranked Bafana&rsquo;s quick-passing&sbquo; high tempo game they will surely try to employ against the 32nd-ranked Lions of Teranga.Mashaba said he was impressed at how his players trained on the wet surface on Friday.Such minor factors might seem incidental&sbquo; but in a match that seems bound to be settled by the narrowest of margins&sbquo; every bit just might count."The rain that came this morning was a blessing in disguise&sbquo;" Mashaba said."It was preparing our boys. After the session&sbquo; I told them it was the first time in my life I had seen our players playing so well under the rain."They were buzzing&sbquo; playing one touch and two touch&sbquo; and took shots as well. We&rsquo;re waiting for the game tomorrow &ndash; I think we&rsquo;ll put smiles on people&rsquo;s faces."Bafana have been warmly received in Polokwane&sbquo; with everyone they meet offering their support for a big game.The director for sports development for Limpopo&sbquo; Junior Ramusi&sbquo; said: "The people of Limpopo received the national team well at Polokwane International Airport."There was a reception by supporters&sbquo; and the provincial government put weight behind welcoming Bafana &ndash; we had the MEC for Sport&sbquo; the executive mayor of Polokwane and the executive mayor of the Capricorn district."On Friday the team went to the Mall of the North&sbquo; where thousands of people came to greet them."One also cannot ignore the elephant in the room&sbquo; though.This game might not just have the potential to make or break the coming years&rsquo; fortunes of two underachieving national teams.It could also decide the continuity of the latest&sbquo; and surely final&sbquo; Bafana tenure of Mashaba.Both SA Football Association (Safa) CEO Dennis Mumble and president Danny Jordaan have travelled to Polokwane in support of the team.Should Bafana lose&sbquo; so soon after a failure to reach the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations&sbquo; and put themselves in an almost impossible situation in Group D&sbquo; the Safa bosses will be on hand to dish out swift action&sbquo; should they feel it is required.Senegal have the stronger team on paper.They went through the Afcon 2017 qualifiers with a 100% record with six wins from six&sbquo; and are the favourites.Bafana have been buoyed by Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; confidence-boosting Caf Champions League victory&sbquo; Mashaba has some real talent at his disposal&sbquo; they have home advantage&sbquo; and the feeling that perhaps South African football is on the cusp of something special.That the tide of history might just have finally turned for SA football.This will be a nail-biter.TMG Digital
