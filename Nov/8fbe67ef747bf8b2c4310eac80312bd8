The rand steadied on Monday morning at the start of a fairly busy week, the highlight of which will be the Reserve Bank’s decision on interest rates on Thursday. The rand volatility and its potential implication on the inflation outlook is likely to be highlighted when the Bank’s monetary policy committee wraps up its three-day meeting. The rand has recently depreciated sharply against the dollar and other major currencies, thanks to a strong dollar that is drawing support from higher interest rate expectations in the US. "While we grapple with a bullish dollar and an impending rate hike in December, we need to keep in mind the rating review by S&P [Global Ratings] on the 2nd of December," said Wichard Cilliers, head of dealing and a director at TreasuryOne. S&P, which is has SA’s credit rating just one-notch above subinvestment grade status, will be closely watched, as will Moody’s, which is scheduled to review its decision before the end of November. Markets will also keep a watchful eye on the local inflation data on Wednesday, with Trading Economics expecting the consumer inflation to have steadied at an annual rate of 6.1% in October, unchanged from September.

It was at R15.3113 to the euro from R15.2913 and R17.8089 to the pound from R17.8239 The euro was at $1.0610, from $1.0592. © Business Day 2016
