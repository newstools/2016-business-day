A sum of R3,500 is unlikely to improve the lot of poor households, economists say. Poor South Africans spend most of their income on food and transport and have to find ways to supplement this, for example by getting income from other family members. On average, low-income households spend about R1,000 on food. Transport also eats up a large chunk of income. This is why R3,500 is unlikely to make a dent in the lot of the poor, according to Standard Bank economist Kim Silberman and economist Mike Schussler. Silberman said that for "households that earn R3,500 per month, expenditure is greater than income". Transport costs absorbed at least 13% of that income. "They don’t make ends meet," Silberman said. Little money was available to meet education, clothing and discretionary costs, she said. Schussler said a R3,500 minimum wage was meagre for a family. "In most cases, the minimum wage is for low-skilled and younger workers who often don’t yet have a family. "Nowhere in the world is a minimum wage a living wage," said Schussler. The nonagricultural formal sector, which includes finance, community service, mining and manufacturing, could possibly afford the minimum wage given that implementation was stretched across two years. These sectors pay close to the minimum wage. But Schussler anticipated difficulties for hairdressers, nail technicians and private security. Domestic workers will get 75% of the minimum wage within a year or so of its implementation, which works out to about R2,625. However, agriculture would struggle with R3,100 unless the sector was given more time to implement, he said. Silberman cautioned "not everybody will implement. In other countries the implementation rate is around 60%, so you’ve got to temper your expectations on consumption by the potential job losses and by the implementation rate."
