ANC Youth League president Collen Maine has accused Cosatu of holding a gun to the ANC&rsquo;s head by publicly endorsing Cyril Ramaphosa to lead the party."It is quite unfair of them. What they are doing is unfair to the branches of the ANC," he said on Thursday following Cosatu&rsquo;s announcement."They are putting a gun to our heads."The ANCYL and Maine are strong allies of President Jacob Zuma and a faction in the ANC dubbed the "premier league".It is expected to back African Union commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as the next president of the party.The ANC is holding its next elective conference in December next year where it will elect Zuma s successor.Earlier on Thursday, Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali speaking after the central executive committee meeting said federation bosses reflected on the ANC s "political gridlock"."After intense and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reins as the president of the ANC," Ntshalintshali said.Cosatu will lobby ANC structures to support Ramaphosa.The endorsement of Ramaphosa has been a long time coming, with most Cosatu unions lobbying for the federation to take a position and publicly announce it.However, Maine said Cosatu s public declaration was unwarranted, and just because they were part of the alliance did not mean they should have a say on who leads the ANC."They must focus on rebuilding Cosatu and leave ANC [matters alone]."The ANC did not pronounce on Cosatu leadership ahead of the federation s congress."Part of the challenge is that people will sit in Cosatu House and decide for the ANC. The ANC does not dictate to Cosatu who should lead and Cosatu must not do the same with the party," he said.With Natasha Marrian
