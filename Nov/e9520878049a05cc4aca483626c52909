The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) on Friday slammed Cosatu’s decision to endorse Cyril Ramaphosa to replace Jacob Zuma as president of the ANC in 2017. "An ANC government led by Cyril Ramaphosa will be no better than the one led by Jacob Zuma‚" Numsa said. Its general secretary Irvin Jim said the union was "disgusted" by Cosatu’s decision to endorse Ramaphosa "to take over as leader of the ANC and that it will be campaigning and lobbying to influence ANC structures to support its call". On Thursday Cosatu said its central executive committee had resolved to support Ramaphosa "to take over the reins as the next president of the ANC.... The ANC leadership to be elected must have a commitment to fight against corruption and also unify the movement." Jim criticised the decision‚ saying: "Numsa has already put on record its view that Cyril Ramaphosa is an enemy of the working class. "He has consistently attacked workers’ hard-won gains and defended the interests of the exploiting capitalist class‚ most recently when he supported legislation to maintain poverty wages and the super-exploitation of black and African labour under the disguise of national minimum wage at a level which will leave millions of workers in wage-slavery. "Worst of all‚ as a director of Lonmin‚ he was directly implicated in the massacre of 34 Marikana workers who demanded a living wage of R12,500. By now announcing a national minimum wage of R3,500 he is spitting on the graves of those workers who suffered exploitation until the oppressive agents of the capitalist state took their lives." Jim added that an ANC-led government under Ramaphosa "will continue to consolidate the power of white monopoly capitalism and to reassure credit ratings agencies that SA is a good place to invest and exploit our natural resources and cheap labour".
