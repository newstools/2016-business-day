Adelaide &mdash; Faf du Plessis beat the booing to keep SA&rsquo;s heads above water on the first day of the third test against Australia in Adelaide on Thursday.Du Plessis&sbquo; who was fined 100% of his match fee on Tuesday for ball-tampering during the second test in Hobart&sbquo; was roundly booed when he stepped over the boundary to begin his innings.But SA&rsquo;s captain was 65 not out with Kyle Abbott on one at dinner&sbquo; which the visitors reached on 165/7.SA&sbquo; who have already won the series&sbquo; lost 89/3 in the first session and 76/4 between tea and dinner on their first day of pink-ball&sbquo; day-night Test cricket.Stephen Cook used an early reprieve to make 40&sbquo; his best effort in nine innings across all formats and at all levels&sbquo; and only the second time in those trips to the crease that he has reached 20.Cook was given out leg before wicket to Mitchell Starc for four with the 18th ball of the match. Replays showed Starc had overstepped.But the visitors slumped to 44/3 in the first hour with Dean Elgar&sbquo; Hashim Amla and JP Duminy all back in the hut.Elgar edged Starc to third slip in the seventh over&sbquo; while Josh Hazlewood had Amla caught at first slip and Duminy taken by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Hazlewood has dismissed Amla in all of his four innings in the series but his delivery to remove Duminy came close to being ruled a no-ball.Duminy&rsquo;s demise brought Du Plessis to the crease&sbquo; and he shared 51 with Cook before the latter was caught at second slip off Starc.Jackson Bird&sbquo; playing his first test since February&sbquo; had Temba Bavuma caught behind.Quinton de Kock scored 24 before falling in similar fashion to Hazlewood.Hazlewood&sbquo; who dined on figures of 4/36&sbquo; struck the last blow of the second session by finding the thinnest of edges on Vernon Philander&rsquo;s bat for another catch by Wade.TMG Digital
