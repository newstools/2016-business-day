SA&rsquo;s weak economic growth was raised at the weekend meeting between the Treasury and representatives of ratings agency S&amp;P Global.The Treasury has revised SA&rsquo;s economic growth prospects downwards this year, from 0.9% to 0.5%. This is the slowest projection since the 2009 global recession.Among the three major international ratings agencies, S&amp;P has SA on the lowest level of investment grade and is expected to announce its review results on December 2.A snap poll by Bloomberg last week showed that more than half of 12 economists surveyed said S&amp;P will strip SA of its investment-level rating.A downgrade by S&amp;P to junk would be the first in more than a decade, ranking SA on par with Russia and Brazil."The issue is the question of growth and what is being done to grow the economy," Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile said after the meeting.He urged the ratings agencies to be patient with SA. "I said to these people, you&rsquo;ve got to be patient with us. Speculation of what we will do is not helpful."It is important to see if we still have more room on the revenue and expenditure side. And if the context is right for what we say we will do," Fuzile said.Prospects for economic growth in 2017 have improved, with S&amp;P recently forecasting 1.5% for the country.The Reserve Bank was more pessimistic with an outlook of 1.2%, and in the medium-term budget policy statement, the Treasury said it expected 1.3%.S&amp;P Africa MD and regional manager Konrad Reuss declined to comment on the meeting.During the past week, the agencies have held a flurry of meetings with politicians, labour representatives, the government and business leaders.On Sunday, S&amp;P was also expected to meet Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.Fuzile said the message conveyed to S&amp;P on Sunday was that the government was working to restore policy certainty, particularly in the mining sector and labour markets.S&amp;P was also keen to know whether economic growth could be fast or robust enough to realise fiscal targets and achieve revenue growth. And if this growth was not achieved, how the Treasury would respond.The Treasury was "committed to our fiscal objectives of making sure we improve our fiscal metrics". In the medium term "it is firmly embedded", Fuzile said.
