South African bond yields were weaker at midday on Friday as US treasuries moved higher again and the market awaited ratings agency Moody’s verdict on SA’s credit rating later in the day. Moody’s has the country’s credit rating two notches above subinvestment grade. At 11.47am the yield on the benchmark R186 was bid at 9.060% from a previous 9.020%, and the R207 was bid at 8.280% from 8.245%. The yield on the US 10-year note rose to 2.3762% from 2.3516%. The UK 10-year gilt firmed to 1.285% from 1.298%. Analysts were sceptical about whether bond yields would hold up at present levels if the rand weakened on a subinvestment downgrade. "What makes us nervous is that the US treasury curve has already steepened markedly, and the dollar is at its strongest for 14 years, yet the rand has held in," said Nomura analyst Peter Attard Montalto. That can change very quickly, but likely unpredictably, he said.
