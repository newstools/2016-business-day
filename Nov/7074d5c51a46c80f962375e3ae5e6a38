Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas gave MPs a glimmer of hope on Wednesday the new SAA board is functioning well and has addressed some issues Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan flagged when they were appointed two months ago.Stability of the SAA board and management &mdash; rocked by scandals, conflicts and departures over many years &mdash; is critical if the state-owned airline is to become profitable and financially self-sufficient.But while governance may be improving, the airline is continuing to make losses, which for the first six months of the current financial year amount to R2bn. It is worse than the R1.5bn loss suffered for the whole of 2015/16. A R1.38bn net loss was made in the first quarter and R765m in the second quarter."The new board of SAA has been functioning very well &hellip; The focus now needs to be on its delivery and output," Jonas told members of Parliament&rsquo;s finance committee during a briefing by SAA executives on the airline&rsquo;s quarterly performance. He said the board was reviewing SAA&rsquo;s long turnaround strategy, a revised version of which would be presented to the Treasury early in January for finalisation by February. Robust discussions were being held between SAA executives and Treasury officials, he said.Jonas said any recapitalisation would be accomplished within the airline&rsquo;s balance sheet or through the sale of noncore assets within the state-owned sector without any reliance on the fiscus.The appointment of a permanent CEO and chief financial officer was being prioritised and would hopefully be finalised by the end of February at the latest.The Treasury was insisting that SAA continue with its cost-cutting drive, and refine its network and fleet plan.Acting chief financial officer Phumeza Nhantsi told MPs market conditions had caused SAA to miss budget targets as it battles intense domestic competition. Rivals had gouged out R1bn in revenue in the second quarter of the 2016/17 financial year. A bottom line loss of R765m was suffered compared with a budgeted R61m loss with finance costs of R288m having a significant effect.Foreign exchange losses for the period amounted to R592m, Nhantsi said.SAA lost market share due to the entry into the market of two new low-cost carriers and the fact that foreign operators such as Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar were flying directly to Durban and Cape Town.She gave the assurance that the latest R4.7bn state guarantee granted to SAA &mdash; that brought the total to R19bn &mdash; would carry the airline through until September 2017.SAA&rsquo;s low-cost subsidiary Mango made a R37m loss in the year to end March, a reversal from the R38m profit the previous year on a revenue growth to R2.3bn from R2.2bn in 2014/15. Mango carried 3-million passengers last year, a 21% increase over the previous year.Fuel costs were 14% lower but dollar-related expenditure added to operational costs.Investment revenue of R52m compared to R47m the previous year meant that the bottom-line loss was less severe.&nbsp;
