South African bond yields edged up on Friday morning ahead of a keenly awaited decision from Moody’s on SA’s credit rating later in the day. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said trading on Friday "should continue being relatively quiet" ahead of Moody’s as Moody’s announcement. "That, coupled with the fact that most of the US have decided to take an extended Thanksgiving weekend, should [reduce] liquidity, and markets will continue to trade in tight ranges." Moody’s has the country’s credit rating a couple of notches above subinvestment grade. The yield on the benchmark R186 was at 9.070% in early trade, from 9.020% on Thursday. The yield on the US 10-year note rose to 2.3816% from 2.3516%.
