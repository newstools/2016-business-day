University of the Witwatersrand Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini will appear again on Tuesday in the Johannesburg Central Magistrate&rsquo;s Court.Dlamini&sbquo; 30&sbquo; was arrested on October 15 at his Wits residence and is facing charges of public violence&sbquo; theft&sbquo; malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.Last week&sbquo; advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi appeared for Dlamini at a sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate&rsquo;s Court and secured him bail of R2000. The student activist had spent three weeks in custody.They argued that Dlamini&rsquo;s arrest and prosecution was part of a political conspiracy&sbquo; basing their argument on a meeting that took place at the ANC Luthuli House headquarters on October 10, attended by National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams.Dlamini's lawyers have written to the NPA seeking confirmation that Abrahams's meeting with Cabinet ministers and President Jacob Zuma at Luthuli House was about the student protests.That meeting took place the day before Abrahams announced charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two other former senior South African Revenue Service (SARS) officials, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, which were later dropped.The timing of the meeting added to suspicion that the charges were politically motivated, but Abrahams has insisted more than once that the meeting was about the student protests.TMG Digital
