A former finance director accused by JSE-listed Acc&eacute;ntuate of defrauding it of R70m over 10 years received an 18-year prison sentence."We are pleased with the sentence handed down, which means that as a management team we are able to put this matter behind us, knowing that we ensured that the perpetrator is accordingly punished and furthermore that a precedent is set for future sentencing of people who commit atrocities such as this," Acc&eacute;ntuate CEO Fred Platt said in a statement on Tuesday.The former finance director of Acc&eacute;ntuate&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary FloorworX Africa, Louis Schreuder, was found guilty on 779 counts of fraud to the value of R70m. The Asset Forfeiture Unit has applied for an order to confiscate Schreuder&rsquo;s assets, a process that was still proceeding, the statement said.In its most recent financial results released in September, Acc&eacute;ntuate included a writedown of R5.36m for the fraud in its year to end-June after writing down R11.06m in its 2015 financial year."The fraud was detected as part of an internal audit investigation and had a material impact on the business. As announced in our interim results, a number of steps have been taken to fully understand the extent of the fraud, evaluate the control environment to detect any further weaknesses and to take the necessary remedial action in order to avoid a recurrence, as well as ensure a strong and reliable reporting foundation for the anticipated growth across the organisation," Acc&eacute;ntuate said in its results statement.
