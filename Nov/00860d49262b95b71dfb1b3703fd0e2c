According to the Sunday Times Absa closed the bank accounts of Fana Hlognwane because they were linked to tainted money he obtained via the arms deal. Hlongwane masqueraded as a "consultant" in the government’s controversial arms deal and he was allegedly paid more than R200-million in commission at the time. Hlongwane was a special adviser to the then defence minister Joe Modise when the R46-billion arms deal was signed in December 1999. Absa closed Hlongwane’s accounts, which had multimillion-rand balances, in August 2013 after he was classified as a "politically exposed person" and a "high-risk client". This followed a Sunday Times report in 2010, which said documents in the newspaper’s possession showed the businessman had been indirectly paid more than R200-million by British defence company BAE and its agents. It is suspected the cash was used to bribe officials. Read the full story here.
