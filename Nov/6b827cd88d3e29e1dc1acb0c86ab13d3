SA captain Faf du Plessis has presided over his second series victory over Australia&sbquo; but he is not done.Having led SA to a 5-0 victory in a one-day series in SA last month and a 2-0 triumph in the Test series that was decided at Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Tuesday &mdash; when the visitors won by an innings and 80 runs &mdash; Du Plessis reckons there&rsquo;s another win in his team&rsquo;s tank: the third Test in Adelaide that starts next Thursday."That&rsquo;s the mission for us now&sbquo; we want to do that very badly&sbquo;" Du Plessis said after his team wrapped up victory on the fourth day of a match in which the entire second day was washed out."It was the same with the ODIs. We won&rsquo;t rest on our laurels and be happy with 2-1 or even 2-0."We&rsquo;ve got Australia in a position where they are under pressure and we don&rsquo;t want to let that go. It&rsquo;s hard enough to get them in this position so we&rsquo;ll do everything we can to keep them there."As focused as he was on what he wanted SA to do&sbquo; Du Plessis was nonetheless surprised that they managed to take eight wickets for 32 runs in the space of 95 minutes and 116 deliveries to clinch victory on Tuesday."I didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen (that quickly)&sbquo;" Du Plessis said."Our bowling was exceptional (on Monday). The last hour-and-a-half&sbquo; we were so good in our areas and relentless."We didn&rsquo;t get the results we wanted but we knew (on Tuesday) if we came back it will change for us."To get eight wickets for 40 runs&sbquo; plus minus&sbquo; is one of those sessions we will always remember as a team."That won us the series and it was unbelievable. That ranks right at the top."To do it in the one-dayers and beat them 5-0 (was special), but to come here&sbquo; we as a team know that&rsquo;s an extremely hard challenge to come here and beat a really good team."They&rsquo;ve got a full-strength team; there&rsquo;s no injuries. So to come here and do what we&rsquo;ve done is right up there&sbquo; certainly in my career."The Adelaide Test will be SA&rsquo;s first under lights and using the pink ball.TMG Sport
