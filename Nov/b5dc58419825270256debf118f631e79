The country&rsquo;s two top black jockeys, S&rsquo;manga Khumalo and Muzi Yeni, have landed the two plum rides in the R2m Sansui Summer Cup at Turffontein on November 26.Champion trainer Sean Tarry has engaged Khumalo for Liege and Yeni for Aussie-bred Samurai Blade. The two stablemates have been at the top of the bookies betting boards over the past seven days.Tarry will be happy with Liege&rsquo;s close second in last Sunday&rsquo;s grade2 Victory Moon Stakes and it should have teed up the son of Dynasty perfectly for Joburg&rsquo;s biggest race of the year.Another important factor is that Tarry&rsquo;s stable is sending out its usual steady stream of winners: he saddled four at the Vaal on Tuesday.Khumalo looks unlikely to retain his title as he has only recently returned to the track after serving a two-month suspension. However, victory on Liege with its big purse will see Khumalo end the year on a high note and also help Tarry in his battle with Justin Snaith in the trainers&rsquo; championship.Although the weather resulted in Samurai Blade missing his planned prep race last weekend, there has been a persistent whisper that he is the stable fancy.He will be ridden by Muzi Yeni, who tuned up for the internationals and Summer Cup by booting home a four-timer at Kimberley on Monday.Former champion Anton Marcus, retained by leading owner Markus Jooste, has opted for Deo Juvente in preference to St Tropez. Deo Juvente&rsquo;s good performance in the Peermont Emperors Charity Mile is sure to have been an important factor in Marcus&rsquo;s decision.Geoff Woodruff is sweet on the chance of Master Sabina repeating his win of 12 months ago and I doubt if Gavin Lerena would swop mounts with anyone.Craig Zackey is another jockey enjoying a purple patch and he rode three legs of the jackpot at the Vaal on Thursday. His Cup mount, Saratoga Dancer, won many admirers when filling second place behind New Predator in the Charity Mile.Ten Gun Salute, stable companion of Saratoga Dancer, finished sixth in the Charity Mile and makes plenty of appeal as a place bet &mdash; particularly as Betting World are paying out on the first five horses home.Mac De Lago, who ran a creditable third for Business Day readers in the July, may be caught out this time by his big weight, although he has a master horseman in Weichong Marwing in the saddle.The Tarry bandwagon is set to roll on at the Vaal on Thursday where lightly-raced four-year-old Fieldmarshal Fenix could be a banker bet for punters in the final leg of the jackpot.With a win and a second in his two outings, Fieldmarshal Fenix may be ahead of the handicapper and his chief rival is likely to be Stanley Ferreira&rsquo;s three-year-old, Alpine Glacier.Although evergreen Greasepaint will again have his supporters in the seventh race, the combination of trainer Corne Spies and jockey Craig Zackey will be no pushover with the filly Seattle Singer.
