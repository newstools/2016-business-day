Investec will continue to shift from "capital-heavy" to "capital-light" activities as part of its efforts to raise return on equity from the bottom to the top of its target range in response to calls from investors.The specialist banking and wealth management group reported solid results in a volatile environment for the six months to end-September, with a 1.6% increase in operating profit on a currency neutral basis, to &pound;281.4m.Investec, which is dual-listed in London and Johannesburg and reports in sterling, benefited from &pound;1.8bn of net inflows, with its less capital-intensive asset and wealth management businesses increasing their contribution to 39.9% of operating profit, from 34% in the comparable period. It now has &pound;141.8bn in third-party assets under management, up 10.3% on a currency-neutral basis on the comparable period (but up 16.5% in pound terms).The rand exchange rate boosted the balance sheet (in pound terms) because it appreciated 15.4% against the pound from September 2015 to September 2016, but it detracted from the income statement because the average exchange rate for the six months depreciated 3.4%. Capital has become a key constraint for banks in a tighter regulatory environment, while businesses such as asset and wealth management and transactional banking require relatively little capital.Investec CEO Stephen Koseff said the contribution from the less capital-intensive businesses had increased to 58% in the latest period, from 40% eight years ago. The group would like to get this ratio as high as possible, to get the return its investors wanted, but to get to 60%-65% was not that easy. Koseff said Investec was still lending money and needed to use its capital to look after its banking clients.Investec was always looking for acquisitions in the UK wealth management space, he said, serving high-end private clients, but there was nothing available.The group&rsquo;s target is a (post-tax) return on equity of 12%-16% over a rolling five-year period. For the six months to end-September, the return was down slightly at 12.1%, from 12.6% a year ago, but Koseff said it would be 13.9% if the "legacy business" was stripped out.The legacy loans were made by Investec&rsquo;s UK banking business before the financial crisis &mdash; at the wrong price &mdash; and, like other UK banks, Investec is gradually writing them down. The legacy book has declined from &pound;7bn in 2010 to &pound;535m in the half year under review, in which the bank took a &pound;33m loss on the loans. Progress had been made, Koseff said, but it would take another three years to clear all the legacy loans.The results reflected growth in net interest income and in fees and commissions, as well as in third-party funds under management. The combined UK and other businesses were up 1.3% in sterling terms, but the South African business was marginally down because group investment income was hit by the Investec Equity Partners transaction in January, which saw the group create a new investment vehicle to hold its private equity business and sell 55% of this to (undisclosed) strategic investors. The deal also reflected the move to lighten capital requirements.Koseff said results for the next six months would depend on geopolitical developments and on the rand.iThe share price rose 3.8% and 4.2% in London and Johannesburg, respectively, outpacing both the pan-European STOXX 600 and the JSE top 40 index.The operational performance was strong, said one analyst, while assets under management also did better than expected.With Reuters
