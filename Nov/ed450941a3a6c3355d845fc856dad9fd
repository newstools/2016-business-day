It was a stark reflection of the state of South African rugby that only Blitzbok star Seabelo Senatla was recognised with a nomination for World Rugby’s annual awards on Tuesday, writes Craig Ray. New Zealand players and their national team‚ the All Blacks‚ predictably dominated the nominations for the awards‚ which will be made in London on November 13. SA’s only other recognition came via nods for referees Jaco Peyper and Rasta Rasivhenge in the world referee of the year category. They will compete against Jérôme Garcès of France and Spain’s Alhambra Nievas. Senatla is one of three nominees for World Rugby’s sevens rugby player of the year award. It is his second successive nomination for this honour‚ which was won by Blitzbok Werner Kok in 2015. World Rugby announced on Tuesday that Senatla‚ who scored 66 tries in the 2015-16 HSBC World Sevens Series‚ was on the shortlist alongside Virimi Vakatawa (France) and Osea Kolinisau (Fiji). The flying South African was already named top try-scorer for the season by World Rugby when the 2015-16 series concluded in London. Senatla‚ who was last week named the Springbok sevens player of the year, will try to emulate Kok and another Springbok Sevens teammate‚ Cecil Afrika‚ who was named the best sevens player on the planet in 2011. The nominations for the world player of the year for men and women will be announced on November 7. TMG Digital
