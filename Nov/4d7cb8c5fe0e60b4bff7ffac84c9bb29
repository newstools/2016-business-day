The South African bond market was little changed on Thursday morning as market participants awaited possible guidance from the South African Reserve Bank, which wraps up its three-day meeting later in the day. Although the committee is widely expected to keep rates on hold, investors will pay close attention to governor Lesetja Kganyagoâ€™s comments for clues on the path the committee is likely to adopt in the future. The meeting also came as consumer inflation accelerated to an annualised rate of 6.4% in October from 6.1% in September. The yield on the benchmark R186 was at 9.020% in early trade, from 8.980% on Wednesday. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Deon Kohlmeyer said higher than expected consumer inflation weighed on the bond market, as did US treasury yields on Wednesday.
