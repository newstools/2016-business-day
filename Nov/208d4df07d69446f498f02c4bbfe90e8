The DA will on Thursday lay criminal charges against Eskom CEO Brian Molefe in Cape Town.This comes two days after the party&rsquo;s leader&sbquo; Mmusi Maimane&sbquo; laid corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma&sbquo; on the basis of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report&sbquo; which made a number of observations about the relationship between the president and the Gupta family.The DA&rsquo;s Natasha Mazzone said the charges against Molefe would be under the "Public Finance Management Act; Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act; and the Powers&sbquo; Privileges and Immunities of Parliaments and Provincial Legislatures Act"."We cannot stand by as those in positions of power are allowed to abuse state institutions for their own selfish gain and to the detriment of South Africans&sbquo;" she said in a statement."It is now time that he is brought to book and these charges are a step towards ensuring that this happens."Molefe recently resigned from Eskom in the interests of good corporate governance&sbquo; but said his resignation was not an admission of wrongdoing on his part.He had&sbquo; at an earlier Eskom briefing&sbquo; become emotional and appeared to break down in tears while trying to explain his movements in Saxonwold&sbquo; the Johannesburg suburb where the Gupta family resides.On Wednesday&sbquo; BusinessLIVE reported that Mark Pamensky&sbquo; the Eskom director most directly linked to the Gupta family&sbquo; had resigned from the board.Pamensky&sbquo; who is also a director of telecoms company Blue Label as well as of the Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources&sbquo; was among those subpoenaed by Madonsela for her report.Adding to Eskom&rsquo;s woes is a call from the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) for the "resignation of the entire board and divisional executives who are all implicated in the many serious allegations against Eskom in the former public protector&rsquo;s report".The allegations in that report "are sufficiently serious to make it impossible for Molefe and the Eskom board to continue with business as usual and they must stand down"&sbquo; Numsa general-secretary Irvin Jim said.TMG Digital
