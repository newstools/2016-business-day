State Security Minister David Mahlobo has presided over a "dangerous creep" of state security into politics and public life&sbquo; says Right2Know Campaign.The activist group on Friday questioned whether the minister&rsquo;s words could be trusted and said it was time for him to go."This week&sbquo; the minister was revealed to have an unexplained personal relationship with a self-confessed rhino horn trafficker. His denials of any links to this person ring hollow when he also contradicted himself in front of parliament on a different issue&sbquo;" said the organisation.Mahlobo said at a panel discussion hosted by the Institute of Security Studies on Monday that he knew student leader Mcebo Dlamini. "I know Mcebo. He has been to my house several times&sbquo;" he was quoted as saying by the Mail &amp; Guardian.On Wednesday&sbquo; he told parliament: "Mcebo (Dlamini) has never been to my house.""One of those statements is untrue: the question is if he misled a public seminar or misled parliament itself. If he misled us on this issue&sbquo; when can the minister&rsquo;s words be trusted&sbquo;" asked Right2Know.The organisation took Mahlobo to task for claiming that some civil society organisations had a "regime change" agenda and had threatened to "deregister" organisations that pursued activities he believed should not be tolerated."He has revealed that (the Department of State Security) has become so paranoid that it has even concerned itself with the ideological contents of university curricula&sbquo; saying this week that the SSA has a list of academics whose teaching of pan-African studies at universities is conditioning students into &lsquo;Afro-pessimism&rsquo;."Right2Know said there was a tendency for leaders of the country&rsquo;s security agencies "to view certain constitutional activities and pro-democratic activism as threats to security and stability".TMG Digital
