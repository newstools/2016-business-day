Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom appeared to be in a philosophical mood on Wednesday morning&sbquo; a day after the ANC confirmed that his bid to have President Jacob Zuma removed had failed.Taking a break from his usual tweets about the tourism industry&sbquo; he tweeted: "&lsquo;A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks that others throw at him.&rsquo; Thomas Jefferson."He followed the former US president&rsquo;s words with a quote from motivational speaker Dennis Waitley: "There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist&sbquo; or accept the responsibility for changing them."He had earlier retweeted Great Minds post: " Don t hate it s too big a burden to bear. Martin Luther King."There were questions over whether Hanekom would retain his Cabinet post after he broke ranks with Zuma s backers and filed a motion of no confidence in the party leader at a national executive committee (NEC) meeting.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said after announcing on Tuesday that Zuma would not be stepping down that there would be no victimisation of those who criticised Zuma."We don t have this thing called ministers who talk in the NEC as ministers. Deployment is a different matter and I m sure [that] if they made a call that call in a Cabinet meeting that question would be relevant. Those members were given a right [and] allowed to continue to discuss an issue raised in that meeting " Mantashe said.TMG Digital
