Bafana Bafana&rsquo;s World Cup dream just might become a reality&sbquo; as they took the lead of Group B with a spectacularly dramatic 2-1 qualifying victory against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.In three minutes just before the break&sbquo; after absorbing pressure from a classy Senegal&sbquo; Thulani Hlatshwayo&rsquo;s 44th-minute penalty and Thulani Serero&rsquo;s strike in injury time made Bafana&rsquo;s Russia 2018 dream suddenly believable.Substitute Cheik Ndoye pulled one back for Senegal in the 78th.Bafana&sbquo; ranked 62nd&sbquo; were the underdogs&sbquo; but Shakes Mashaba&rsquo;s men rode the wave of what now appears a very credible turning of the tide in SA football to run out gutsy winners who can only grow in confidence from this result as these qualifiers continue.It has been a long time since Shosholoza has been belted out so loudly for Bafana in the stands. A good Polokwane home crowd were superb in their support&sbquo; and lapped up a nail-biting 90 minutes.SA&sbquo; who started with a 1-1 away draw against Burkina Faso&sbquo; top Group D with four points with four matches to play.Senegal coach Aliou Cisse has brought around a turnaround since their 1-1 draw against Bafana at the 2015 AfricaCup of Nations where&sbquo; like SA&sbquo; the Lions of Teranga exited in the first round.Senegal won six out of six reaching the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.Cisse brought an imposing line-up for a match that the Senegalese knew&sbquo; if they won&sbquo; would put them firmly in the Group D driving seat.Senegal&rsquo;s array of players from top European clubs is staggering. They had the West Ham and Newcastle giants Cheikhou Kouyate and Mohamed Diame partnering in defensive midfield&sbquo; Napoli centreback Kalidou Koulibaly in defence&sbquo; Everton&rsquo;s Idrissa Gueye at playmaker.Liverpool sensation Sadio Mane&sbquo; who has six EPL goals at his new club&sbquo; was on the right of attack&sbquo; Lazio&rsquo;s Keita Balde on the left. The lone Senegalese-based starter was Moussa Konate at centre-forward.Stoke City striker Mame Biram Diouf was on the bench.Pitted against all this Bafana would rely on home advantage and a strength that Cisse alluded to in the week &ndash; that sometimes it is easier to build a team when you have more local-based players. And the confidence in SA football right now following Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; Caf Champions League victory last month.In the first 26 minutes Mane had a header flash over and Konate drove straight at Itumeleng Khune from range.South Africa had possession but against a team that exuded class in their touches and build-ups were cautious to commit themselves to the attack.They grew in confidence and in the 39th Serero&rsquo;s crossfield pass put Keagan Dolly through to shoot at goalkeeper Abdoulaye Diallo.On a Bafana attack Gueye handled and Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey pointed to the spot.Right-back Hlatshwayo&rsquo;s penalty was well struck low and to the left &ndash; it had to be because Diallo got a touch&sbquo; but could not stop the goal.The 1-0 scoreline seemed too good to be true. It became 2-0 in added time.Mpho Makola played in a low cross that Keagan Dolly passed on to Serero. The Ajax Amsterdam man did not expect the ball and attempted a throughpass that fooled everyone&sbquo; and rolled in past stranded Diallo.The 2-0 deficit made Senegal dangerous coming out of the change rooms&sbquo; because now they had licence to throw all their class forward.Bafana needed to invoke the spirit of Sundowns&rsquo; grind in the Alexandria second leg of the Caf final againstZamalek&sbquo; and fight for everything.Konate should have done better gifted a free header in the 58th.But SA were still dangerous in attack&sbquo; Dolly stretching and missing after being teed up by Serero.Diouf&sbquo; on for Konate&sbquo; should have buried a free header in the 73rd.Senegal finally did get one back&sbquo; as first Diouf&rsquo;s shot was blocked by Makola&sbquo; then another by Khune&sbquo; another substitute Ndoye finally burying the goal&sbquo; setting up an unbearably tense final 10 minutes.TMG Digital
