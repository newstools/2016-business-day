EFF leader Julius Malema is expected to make his second court appearance on Monday, this time in Bloemfontein, in relation to his comments about land occupation.Malema is being charged with contravening the 1956 Riotous Assemblies Act, after he told party members at the EFF&rsquo;s conference in Bloemfontein in 2014 to occupy vacant land.The court matter is expected to go a similar route as last week&rsquo;s, when the firebrand leader appeared in the Newcastle Regional Court on the same charge.The matter was postponed after his lawyer told the court Malema would be approaching the high court to have the Riotous Assemblies Act declared unconstitutional.Malema has until December 7 to lodge his application with the high court. He will appear in the Newcastle Regional Court again on May 7 2017.The charges he faces in the Newcastle court relate to comments Malema made when the EFF commemorated the 61st anniversary of the Freedom Charter at a rally.Shortly after walking out of court last Monday, Malema wasted little time and made similar comments about land occupation while addressing EFF supporters.On Wednesday, auditor-general Kimi Makwetu will release the audit results of the national and provincial departments and their entities for the 2015-16 financial year.In 2015, the auditor-general found there had been irregular expenditure of R25.7bn across SA&rsquo;s departments and entities in 2014-15, but this represented a 27% decrease from the previous year&rsquo;s R35.28bn.Treasury officials will on Tuesday appear before the standing committee on finance to give responses to the employment and leadership tax incentive submissions, while on Wednesday South African Airways will meet with the committee for a follow-up on its annual report.Parliament&rsquo;s rules committee is expected to meet on Wednesday.During the debate on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma last week, opposition MPs argued that the vote should be done by secret ballot.The EFF insisted that, because a president was voted in by secret ballot, a vote to remove him should be done the same way.After several attempts to get the debate under way deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli ruled that the matter of a secret ballot should be taken to the rules committee for deliberation.Also on Wednesday, the peace and security cluster will answer questions in the National Assembly and the Department of Mineral Resources will brief MPs on the process of reviewing the Mining Charter.Statistics SA will brief the portfolio committee on higher education and training on the financial statistics of the tertiary institutions in 2015 and the Department of Higher Education will brief MPs on universities and TVET colleges&rsquo; readiness for the 2017 academic year.Universities have in recent months been crippled by student protests, with many institutions having to suspended lectures for the year.The portfolio committee on public service will on Wednesday interview candidates for the Public Service Commission and report on the findings of the security checks and the verification of candidates&rsquo; qualifications.The portfolio committee on communication will on Friday interview shortlisted candidates for two vacant positions at the Independent Communications Authority of SA.
