Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has received endorsement from an unlikely source: ANC branches seeking nullification of the result of 2015&rsquo;s KwaZulu-Natal provincial conference, also want him to succeed President Jacob Zuma.Last week, trade union federation Cosatu came out in support of Ramaphosa&rsquo;s candidacy and said it would lobby ANC branches to support him. Cosatu described Ramaphosa as a "unifier" who had the "necessary capability to lead the ANC out of its current political gridlock".Now it seems that Ramaphosa may need all his negotiating skills, especially in a province that is the home of another contender for the ANC presidency, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.Sifiso Dlamini, speaking on behalf of the aggrieved ANC branches in KwaZulu-Natal, said on Sunday that principle and ANC traditions dictate that the deputy president of the party assumes the presidency when the term of an incumbent comes to an end."When we campaigned for Zuma to succeed [former president Thabo] Mbeki, we did not do so out of undying love for him or the fact that he comes from KwaZulu-Natal," Dlamini said. "We did so because we understood that it was the principle and tradition of the ANC that a deputy president follows in the footsteps of the president whose term is coming to an end. We cannot allow a situation where some factions that are supported by the president now turn around and overturn this principle when it suits them.Dlamini added: "We believe that Cyril Ramaphosa is a credible leader who can take this country forward. He has a gravitas to become a good leader and he should not be overlooked."Held in November 2015, the ANC provincial conference elected a slate of leadership led by current provincial chairman and MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs Sihle Zikalala, who defeated former KwaZulu-Natal premier Senzo Mchunu.Two weeks after the elective conference, scores of ANC supporters marched to the party s provincial office in Durban, demanding the elective conference result to be set aside. The "dissidents" say the ANC s national leadership has still not responded despite promising to do so, which forced them to approach the courts.In May, ANC members Lawrence Dube, Sibahle Zikalala, Martin Mzangwa, Mzweni Ngcobo and Lindiwe Buthelezi backed by some branches in eTthekwini and other regions that supported former premier Mchunu approached the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, seeking to have results of the provincial conference overturned.The matter was heard before the court last Wednesday during which the ANC s lawyers asked for a postponement and requested documents from the applicants. It is expected to resume on January 21.Lindokuhle Khoza, another leader of the dissident group on Sunday said they were confident of victory."We strongly believe that the court will overturn the results as we will present all the evidence that the elective conference was rigged," he said.
