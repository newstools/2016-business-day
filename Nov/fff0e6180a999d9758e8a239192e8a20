The JSE opened marginally firmer on Wednesday after the Dow Jones closed above 19,000 points for the first time ever on Tuesday and as a stronger Anglo American supported resources. The Dow surged mainly on steel shares, which closed higher after president-elect Donald Trump said he would cancel the free trade Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement when he assumed office in January. Gold shares were also higher on a slightly weaker dollar and a slightly firmer gold price. The Dow closed 0.35% up at 19,023.87 points with Chinese markets mixed on Wednesday morning. The Hang Seng added 0.10% but the Shanghai Composite shed 0.22%. The Nikkei was closed due to a Japanese public holiday. Due to the Japanese holiday, together with Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the US, trade was expected to be subdued for the next few days. The local market was also eyeing October’s consumer inflation data set to be released later in the morning. A slight pick-up was expected from September’s 6.1%, but the Reserve Bank was still set to keep rates unchanged at its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, according to consensus forecasts. At 9.30am the all share was 0.19% up at 51,214.20 points, with the blue-chip top 40 adding 0.22%. The gold index rose 2.16%, resources 1.34%, food and drug retailers 1% and platinums 0.75%. Property shed 0.76% and banks 0.47%. Blackrock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said that markets needed to adapt to the reality of higher bond yields. The stable relationship between US treasuries and equity returns was changing as previously bond returns were positive when stock returns took a hit. Blackrock said market expectations were now for US deregulation and fiscal spending under a Trump administration. That need not be negative for emerging markets. "Barring a major shift in trade policies, we see room for further investor inflows into emerging markets," Blackrock said. Among individual shares on the JSE, Anglo American rose 2.01% to R211.15.
