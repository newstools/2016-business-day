The JSE opened on an upbeat note on Monday on a strong close on the Dow on Friday and after SA staved off rating downgrades from Fitch and Moody’s at the weekend. The all share was following a stronger rand, which broke through the R14/$ level in early morning trade. Banks led the pack in risk-on trade and general retailers provided support after a number of positive developments at the weekend. Naspers also supported the market, despite mixed results released on Friday after the market closed. The Dow closed 0.36% higher on Friday at 19,152.14 points, yet another record. The rise was mainly on US utilities companies, with little economic data pointing the way on Black Friday. Fitch lowered its outlook to negative on Friday, but both Fitch and Moody’s left their ratings unchanged. "Although the news from the ratings agencies thus far had been positive, the real test will be on Friday when S&P [Global ratings] makes its announcement," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. Trading volumes on the JSE remained low as the market kept an eye on developments at the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Pretoria, where a concerted bid has been made to oust President Jacob Zuma as ANC leader. The meeting is expected to continue for the rest of Monday. At 9.36am the all share was 0.39% higher at 50,894.30 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.38%.
