The rand was weaker against the dollar at midday on Wednesday following the release by Stats SA of October’s consumer inflation figures. Consumer inflation came in at 6.4% year on year, up from 6.1% in September. Head of dealing and director at TreasuryOne Wichard Cilliers said that it was unlikely to put pressure on the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates. Most economists expect that Reserve Bank will keep interest rates on hold when it announces its decision on Thursday afternoon. Cilliers said that although the rand was softer it continued to run ahead of currencies of emerging market peers, which was a concern, as when it weakened these moves were sometimes also exaggerated. Upcoming US data on manufacturing and the release of the US Federal Open Market Committee minutes at 9pm tonight could affect the rand. Standard Bank trader Inshaan Omar said that the minutes would be scrutinised as they would give insight as to what was to come in the December meeting. Omar said that liquidity would be thin with Japan on holiday today and the US celebrating Thanksgiving on Thursday. The local currency has struggled to break through R14 to the dollar since president-elect Donald Trump took the White House earlier this month. At 11.30am, the rand was at R14.1083 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R14.0583. It was at R14.9637 to the euro from R14.9437 and R17.4588 to the pound from R17.4592 The euro was at $1.0607 from $1.0628.
