The High Court in Pretoria has ordered that regulations capping rates and fees on short-term credit agreements be reviewed and set aside.This is on the grounds that the National Credit Regulator (NCR) and the minister of trade and industry failed to consider the effect these caps would have on the microlending industry and the provision of short-term credit to consumers.The court found that the minister could not support assertions that he had consulted the short-term credit industry and had balanced the rights of consumers and credit providers.Nor could the regulator provide evidence of its own alleged research, including engagements with 19 credit providers.The judgment follows an application brought by MicroFinance SA in terms of the Promotion to Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).Under this act, an administrative decision is reviewable if it has failed to take into account relevant considerations, or was taken arbitrarily or capriciously.Short-term credit agreements include loans not exceeding R8,000, which are repayable within a period of not more than six months.In terms of the National Credit Act credit providers can charge interest, an initiation fee and a service fee on a credit agreement.These costs, which are prescribed by regulations, are to be reviewed by the NCR at intervals of no more than three years.After failing to conduct such a review for nine years, the NCR was eventually ordered by a court to comply with its obligations.New rates and fees on all classes of credit were published by the Department of Trade and Industry in June 2015 for public comment and came into effect in May this year.
