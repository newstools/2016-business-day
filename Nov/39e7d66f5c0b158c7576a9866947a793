Sharjah — Opener Kraigg Brathwaite needed five runs for a fighting hundred as he foiled Pakistan on the second day of the third and final Test here on Monday. Brathwaite anchored the West Indian innings with a 206-ball 95 not out after they were struggling at 38/3, putting two solid stands of 83 each with Roston Chase (50) for the fifth wicket and with Shane Dowrich (47) for the sixth. At close skipper Jason Holder was unbeaten on six as West Indies were 244/6, just 37 runs away from Pakistan’s first innings total of 281. This gives West Indies a good position for the first time in the series against Pakistan who are targeting a 3-0 clean sweep after winning the first Test by 56 runs in Dubai and the second by 133 runs in Abu Dhabi. Brathwaite batted solidly as he negotiated Pakistan’s spin-cum-pace attack with full confidence, hitting 10 boundaries. West Indies lost Jermaine Blackwood for 23 soon after lunch and it looked like they would once again concede a lead but Brathwaite held the innings well with Chase and Dowrich. Chase hit leg-spinner Yasir Shah for a straight six to bring up his 50 but was caught in the slip off Mohammad Amir in the next over. His 89-ball stay was spiced with six fours and a six. Dowrich then complemented Brathwaite as they took West Indies to 234, with Dowrich benefiting from a catch off Wahab Riaz’s no ball on 15 and a let-off by Younis Khan on 21. AFP
