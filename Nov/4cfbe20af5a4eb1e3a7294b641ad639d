The rand was on a firmer footing on Monday morning after SA managed to dodge the sovereign ratings downgrade from two of the three major ratings agencies. Moody’s and Fitch Ratings kept the country’s investment grade status, even as the latter agency lowered its outlook on the country’s debt to negative from stable. S&P Global Ratings will deliver its decision on Friday. "Maintaining investment grade foreign and local currency rating is of utmost importance for SA as it informs terms of our government loans," NKC Research analysts said in a note. "With current debt servicing costs already close to R150bn, further increases in interest rates would be detrimental for SA’s fiscal position as less money would be available to spend on other important spending priorities." The rand strengthened through R14/$ for the first time in little more than two weeks, although the strength was also attributed to a broad dollar correction following its two-week rally. The weaker dollar boosted precious metal prices, including platinum and gold, which have been under pressure since Republican Donald Trump won the US presidential election early in November. At 9.01am, the rand was at R13.9513 to the dollar from Friday’s R14.0350. It was at R14.8513 to the euro from R14.8969 and R17.4333 to the pound from R17.5001 The euro was at $1.0645 from $1.0611.
