Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Tuesday defended the controversial Riotous Assemblies Act, saying it helps the state respond to anarchy and violent behaviour."Laws enforced before the adoption of the Constitution continue to be [relevant] only if consistent with the Constitution," Masutha said during a debate on the act in Parliament.The ANC used its Parliamentary majority to shoot down an EFF motion to repeal the apartheid-era law.The act recently came into sharp focus after EFF leader Julius Malema was charged for contravening its provisions. Allegations were that during the party&rsquo;s elective conference in 2014, Malema incited party members to commit a crime by occupying any vacant land they came across.He has also been charged a second time for a similar transgression for making the same call in Newcastle in 2016.Lobby group AfriForum laid the charges against Malema. The matter will be back in court in December.The EFF is filing an application with the High Court asking that the act be declared unconstitutional.Masutha said the act remained in the statute books with only three remaining provisions concerning public violence."Putting these three provisions aside without a replacement would make the state unable to respond to anarchic behaviour," he said.Opening the debate, EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu said the act should be repealed as it was unconstitutional. He said the ANC government had neglected the responsibility of repealing all apartheid laws."These laws were meant to protect Europeans at the expense of non-Europeans ... Parliament must be the primary organ that is responsible for the repeal of apartheid laws. There are numerous laws that are colonial but the most prevalent is that of the Riotous Assemblies Act," said Shivambu.He reiterated the party&rsquo;s call for ordinary South Africans to occupy vacant landNational Freedom Party MP Sibusiso Mncwabe said Parliament should establish an ad hoc committee to review all apartheid era laws.DA MP Michael Cardo said: "We are witnessing the re-securitisation of public life by securocrats and idiocrats. And apartheid-era legislation has become a weapon in their arsenal. They use laws that violate the constitutional values of freedom, transparency and accountability."Cardo added: "In 1994, we were meant to move from a closed, authoritarian autocracy to an open, egalitarian democracy. But the ANC government &mdash; and especially its security cluster in Cabinet &mdash; seems to want to stall that movement."&nbsp;
