The South African bond market was steady at relatively strong levels on Tuesday morning after offshore investors picked up R2bn of local bonds on Monday. The yield on the benchmark R186 bond was at 8.950% in early trade, unchanged from Monday. The yield on the US 10-year treasury note, which has had a marked effect on the local bond market, was stable at 2.3200% from 2.3218%. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg expects local bonds to remain in a stable range ahead of the release of the consumer inflation figures on Wednesday. "With a large amount of event risk on the cards from Wednesday onwards, we expect bond market trading to continue being muted today with the exception of the bond auction," she said.
