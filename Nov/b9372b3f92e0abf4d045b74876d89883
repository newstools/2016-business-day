DiamondCorp, which put its Lace Diamond Mine subsidiary into business rescue on November 14, is tendering more than 5,000 carats of diamonds for sale in Johannesburg as it dries out its flooded mine and rescues a vital piece of equipment.DiamondCorp, which has suspended its shares on London&rsquo;s Alternative Investment Market and the Johannesburg bourse, said it had pumped water from its underground working areas after a flash flood a couple of weeks ago inundated the mine and damaged a drilling machine.DiamondCorp has submitted an insurance claim for the damage.The company, which has come under severe cash constraints as it nears the completion of the Lace mine near Kroonstad in the Free State, is now tendering 5,130 carats of diamonds it had extracted before the mine was closed.The long-hole drill rig, which was trapped in the flooded working areas and damaged, has been hauled to a higher part of the mine and will be brought to the surface once the declines have been repaired. The machine will be sent to Sandvik for restoration.The drill is critical to drilling holes that are integral to the block cave mining method the company is using to extract the kimberlite."Management, alongside PwC, continue to evaluate the group&rsquo;s financial projections with a view to determining the resultant additional capital requirement that is anticipated to be required in the event of a successful conclusion of the business rescue proceedings," the company said.It has in the past said it will need up to &pound;3m to bring the mine into steady state production.
