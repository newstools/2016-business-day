The JSE opened firmer on Tuesday ahead of the US presidential election with the Dow closing more than 2% higher on Monday in anticipation of a victory by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Clinton is leading on average by four percentage points against Republican candidate Donald Trump, within the margin of error that could lead to a Trump victory. However, Clinton has a solid lead in the electoral college, although some battleground states, including North Carolina and Florida, are too close to call. At 9.35am the all share was 0.60% firmer at 50,607.30 points and the blue-chip top 40 also added 0.60%. Platinums gained 1.66%, banks 1.55%, food and drug retailers 0.85% and resources 0.84%. The Dow closed 2.08% higher on Monday in a broad-based rally led by financials, industrials and healthcare stocks. Barclays Research predicted that a Clinton win should see a moderate rally in US equities. "We see the S&P 500 rallying to 2,150-2,175 if Clinton wins, but near term do not expect new highs as the Italian referendum and December US Federal Reserve Federal open market committee meeting remain overhangs," Barclays said. A Trump win would be negative for equities. "If Trump wins, we see the S&P falling 9% from the high," Barclays said. Among individual shares on the JSE, Anglo American rose 0.87% to R188.65. Sasol climbed 0.30% to R368.25 on a marginally weaker oil price with Brent crude shedding 0.11% to $46.20 a barrel in early morning trade. Standard Bank lifted 1.81% to R149.03 and Barclays Africa added 1.93% to R158.25 amid reports that the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) intends to raise its stake in the group. The Spar Group rose 1.40% to R189.63. The group said on Monday it expected headline earnings per share (HEPS) to be between 20% and 25% higher in the year ended September 30. Rebosis Property Fund was 0.86% higher at R11.60. The share price rocketed as much as 11% on Monday after the group reported 8.2% dividend growth for the full year to end-August.
