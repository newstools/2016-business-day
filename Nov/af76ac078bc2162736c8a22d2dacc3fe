The Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) vowed to press ahead with examinations on Monday‚ with a threat to protesters on its Soshanguve campus: "Any student who misses these exams will lose the 2016 academic year completely." TUT said students would "be searched before boarding buses and/or before entering the examination venues" and no "food or any form of liquid will be allowed onto the buses". "Measures have been put in place to identify those individuals who attempt to intimidate and ruin the futures of the majority of our students who wish to write their exams this year‚" a statement said. The announcement came after a TUT shuttle bus was torched in Soshanguve on Sunday while students were aboard. Students at TUT Soshanguve held a night vigil on Sunday to protest exams going ahead.
