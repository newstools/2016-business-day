Union federation Cosatu on Thursday resolved to support Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in his bid to become the next president of the ANC.Cosatu is the first member of the governing alliance, which also includes the ANC and the SACP, to pronounce on its preference.Its decision comes even as the ANC last week released a statement urging the federation and its affiliates to steer clear of its leadership debate until an appropriate time.The endorsement of Ramaphosa has been a long time coming with most Cosatu unions lobbying for the federation to take a position and publicly announce it.The move is a blow for President Jacob Zuma and his allies, who are pushing for AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over.Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali, speaking after Cosatu s central executive committee, said the federation s leaders reflected on the political gridlock currently in the ANC. After intense and robust debate, the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the Deputy President of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reins as the president of the ANC, Ntshalintshali said.Cosatu is set to lobby and influence ANC structures to support Ramaphosa.The federation also came out in support of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture to look into the alleged corrupt relationship between Zuma, Cabinet ministers and the Gupta family.However, it cautioned against the public lynching of those who had not yet been found guilty by the courts.
