The Eastern Cape continues to struggle to provide basic services, including water, sanitation and power, to all schools. It is also struggling to eradicate inappropriate structures. Substandard infrastructure and lack of basic services are seen as barriers to quality education. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga singled out the Eastern Cape for lagging behind in the provision of sound infrastructure. "The education sector has been plagued with infrastructure challenges as we seek to not only accommodate the huge gains made in terms of access to basic education but also to deal with inappropriate or inadequate infrastructure. "Despite many challenges, progress has been made," she said on Monday. In 2013, following intense lobbying by Equal Education, the Department of Basic Education published the regulations relating to minimum uniform norms and standards for public schools infrastructure. In October 2014, about 474 schools without some form of sanitation had been identified. The minister said that by September 2016 about 408 schools were provided with sanitation. Five schools in the Free State and 61 in the Eastern Cape still did not have access to sanitation. In 2014, about 604 schools without some form of water supply were identified. By September, 523 of those schools were provided with water. A total of 58 schools in the Eastern Cape and 23 in the Free State are still without water. According to the norms and standards for the three-year target, all schools must have access to power supply. In October 2014, just more than 1,100 schools without power were identified. Motshekga said by September about 560 schools had power. Most of the rest are in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Motshekga said that in 2014 about 510 schools built entirely from materials such as asbestos, mud, metal and wood were identified, mostly in the Eastern Cape. In May 2015, an additional 189 schools were identified. By September, about 217 schools were completed.
