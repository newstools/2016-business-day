The potential income tax liability for Tegeta Exploration and Resources &mdash; a company with links to the Gupta family &mdash; after the apparent misuse of rehabilitation funds can be as high as R1.95bn.The State of Capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela shows that funds were transferred to the Bank of Baroda with the consent of the Department of Mineral Resources. There were significant shortfalls following the transfers.Tegeta took control of the Optimum Mine Rehabilitation Trust Fund and the Koornfontein Rehabilitation Trust Fund when it acquired Optimum Coal Mine Holdings from Glencore.The Optimum rehabilitation fund was valued at R1.46bn in June this year, and the Koornfontein fund stood at R280m in May.According to the State of Capture report there was a shortfall of R1.176bn on the Optimum fund investment value in September this year and a shortfall of R81m on the investment value of the Koornfontein fund.The National Environmental Management Act determines that a mine should make financial provision for mining rehabilitation. One way to do this is to create a trust fund and the Income Tax Act is then applicable to the income of the trust.The South African Revenue Service (SARS) says any money earned from this trust fund can be used only for the "rehabilitation, decommissioning and post-closure costs" of the mine.SARS declined to comment specifically on the potential tax liability of Tegeta, citing the privacy provision in the Tax Administration Act.SARS did, however, say that if the funds or earnings from a rehabilitation fund are used for any other purpose, then the rehabilitation entity is in breach of the Income Tax Act."Tax legislation has specific remedies and penalties for the rehabilitation entity and the mining company who paid funds to the rehabilitation entity when funds and earnings are distributed in contravention of its sole purpose," SARS said in response to questions from Business Day.If the funds are distributed for any other purpose, the rehabilitation entity will be taxed on the market value of the distribution.SARS said that when the act was contravened, the mining company that funded the rehabilitation entity and the rehabilitation entity could be taxed on up to twice the market value of the assets held by the rehabilitation entity.Patricia Williams, tax partner at Bowman Gilfillan, says if a rehabilitation company or trust contravenes the Income Tax Act then any amount "improperly used" becomes part of its taxable income in the year of the contravention."This is not a discretionary provision, but an automatic provision," says Williams, who is also a member or the South African Institute of Tax Professionals (SAIT s) Tax Administration Act committee.The public protector report says it is "clear and apparent that the funds were not ring-fenced for the purposes of investment and capital growth"."The interest payments on all the investment accounts were not reinvested and recapitalised but were transferred to the Baroda main account and utilised," the report further states.Williams says if the money was misused, the potential income tax on the improper distribution of the R81m of the Koornfontein fund will amount to R33.2m. Trusts are taxed at 41%.Williams says SARS may prefer to tax the original mining company on twice the value of the assets at the time of the contravention, rather than the trust in order to recover the funds.The tax on the R280m total value of the fund at 28% may amount to R156.8m, if taxed in the mining company. If this were taxed in the trust, it would be R229.6m.The assumed misuse in the Optimum rehabilitation trust amounts to R1.176bn, bringing the tax liability to R482m. Tax on twice the total market value of all assets at the time of the contravention amounts to R1.2bn, if taxed in the trust.SARS can also tax the original mining company on twice the total market value, instead of the trust, bringing the tax bill to R823m for the company."The total potential tax, across both rehabilitation trusts, is a maximum of R1.95bn."Williams says this calls for an immediate "jeopardy assessment" to secure the income tax pending resolution of any factual disputes.The Tax Administration Act allows the SARS commissioner to issue an assessment prior to the normal date, if the commissioner is "satisfied" that it is required to secure the collection of tax that would otherwise be in jeopardy.SARS did not respond to questions relating to the amount of potential tax liability or the need for a jeopardy assessment, stating it was prohibited in terms of the Tax Administration Act to disclose specific taxpayer information.SAIT CEO Keith Engel says the government and industry have gone a long way towards ensuring trust funds dedicated to the environment are used for their intended purpose.Consent from the Department of Mineral Resources for companies to access the funds was supposed to be the fail-safe.Engels says perhaps this area needs to be revisited with more objective, nondiscretionary criteria.
