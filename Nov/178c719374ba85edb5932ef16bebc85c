KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu is said to have asked the ANC in the province to release him from his duties so he can focus on his health.According to insiders, the premier has said the job was too &quot;hectic&quot; and was contributing to his ill health.They said Mchunu, who has been in and out of hospital in the past few years, had hinted that he wanted to be replaced by Sihle Zikalala, ANC provincial chairman and MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs.The sources said Zikalala would then be replaced as MEC by Mthandeni Dlungwane, MEC for education. ANC MPL in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature Gugu Simelane-Zulu is expected to move into the education portfolio, the sources said.Mchunu denied the rumours on Monday.Ndabezinhle Sibiya, the premier&#8217;s spokesman, also said Mchunu was not leaving.Sifiso Kunene, an independent analyst with the Centre for Participatory Democracy, said when Mchunu was appointed, it was known he was warming the seat so that Zikalala would be able to get into government and eventually take over as the premier of the province.&quot;I think it is a strategy by the ANC to test the waters on how the public will react to premier Mchunu stepping down. In fact, those who are close to premier Mchunu say he has been saying privately that he wants out because he is not feeling well. Besides his illness, he has suffered a number of setbacks this year alone. He lost his mother and wife in a space of weeks,&quot; Kunene said.At a media briefing on Monday, Super Zuma, KwaZulu-Natal ANC provincial secretary, said the ANC still had full confidence in Mchunu and he was going nowhere.&quot;The premier is doing a good job. We are aware that some enemies of the ANC are &#8230; spreading negative rumours about the ANC. This is aimed at creating discord and dividing the ANC so that it will fail on its historic mission of bringing a better life to our people.&quot;We cannot ask the premier to step down just because he is sick. Everyone gets sick from time to time. The premier is going nowhere,&quot; Zuma said.&quot;In fact, there will be no reshuffling of the KwaZulu-Natal cabinet because we have full confidence in the whole cabinet, including the premier.&quot;
