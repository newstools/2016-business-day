Diabetes in the Cape is more prevalent in the coloured community, with one in four adults likely to be affected.This is one of the findings of a study into the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among the Bellville South community in the northern suburbs of Cape Town."This population [coloured] has a very high prevalence of diabetes. Over the age of 40, nearly one in every four individuals either have diabetes or are at high risk of developing it," said Rajiv Erasmus from the faculty of medicine and health sciences at Stellenbosch University and lead researcher of the study, which was published in the South African Medical Journal.The research was a collaborative effort between Stellenbosch University, the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Walter Sisulu University and the South African Medical Research Council.According to Statistics SA, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the country. With type 2 diabetes, the body either fails to make enough insulin &ndash; a hormone that regulates the way cells take up sugar &ndash; or resists its effect.Erasmus said the prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies between the different racial groups. Traditionally, it was thought the Indian population had the highest rate of diabetes, but these findings suggest it is even more common among the coloured population.He said although the coloured population seemed to be worst affected, there had been a rising trend in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes across all population groups.For instance, it is estimated that diabetes now affects one in every 10 black South Africans, whereas in the past, one in every 20 individuals from this group had diabetes.Another finding in the study was that more than half of the respondents with diabetes were unaware they had the disease."This is particularly worrying because of the long-term complications of diabetes in which the eyes, heart, skin, blood vessels and kidneys are affected."The presence of diabetes will no doubt exacerbate the already high prevalence of hypertension and chronic kidney disease in our population, hamper economic activity and stretch the limited health facilities," Erasmus said.For the study, researchers assessed 642 randomly selected participants from the Bellville South community for type 2 diabetes and other risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. These included being overweight, having high blood pressure and/or "bad" cholesterol that raises one s risk for heart disease and other health problems.All respondents were 31 years or older.In response to the findings, researchers have launched follow-up studies to uncover the reason for this high prevalence and are assessing diagnosis methods that could simplify the screening process.
