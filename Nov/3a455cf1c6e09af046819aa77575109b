As calls grow louder for the state to provide free education for all, indications are that such an eventuality will remain a pipe dream as costs in the education sector skyrocket.SA&rsquo;s higher education costs grew at twice the national inflation rate over the past 20 years, as packages for tertiary administrators and managers rose exorbitantly. At the same time, state funding for higher education declined in real terms, forcing universities to impose fee increases higher than inflation to mitigate the shortfalls.Several countries that once offered free higher education including Australia, England, Kenya and Mozambique &mdash; have since implemented cost-sharing models in which students make a contribution towards the costs of study.Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande&rsquo;s announcement in September that university fee hikes would be capped at 8% next year, and poor and so-called missing middle students will receive assistance led to widespread and often violent protests on campuses, forcing some universities to close.Protesting students are demanding a 0% fee increase across the board and, ultimately, free tertiary education.In October, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said although the government was working towards free education for the poor, it cannot afford free higher education for all.The parliamentary budget office warns that additional funding from the fiscus will be required &mdash; irrespective of the funding model adopted by the government. More than R250bn will be required in additional funds in the medium term to cover all undergraduate students in the system, the budget office says.It says there are two higher education funding options: the current system in which funding is mixed between the government, student fees and a third stream including private finance; and a "decommodified" model in which the government covers all fees.President Jacob Zuma has appointed a fees commission to explore the viability of free higher education.SalariesUniversity of the Witwatersrand spokeswoman Shirona Patel says South African education including higher education, is in a systemic crisis."It is a crisis that is born of our colonial and apartheid history, but has been exacerbated by poor policy choices in the post-apartheid era," she says."Since 1994, SA has been growing its higher education system, expanding the student base from 420,000 to just over 1-million. Yet the per capita subsidy for higher education has declined in real terms."This has forced universities to increase fees in an effort to maintain quality. The net effect has been to price higher education outside of the hands of ordinary South Africans."Patel says the university and the sector has been chronically underfunded for the past two decades, which has made them "heavily reliant" on fees.Wits university&rsquo;s council budget is about R4bn a year, which covers operational expenses including salaries and research funding.The university obtains one third of its funding from student fees, one third from a government subsidy and one third from other income streams.The university&rsquo;s total income for this year, based on expected subsidies, fees, enrolment targets and cost recovery is projected at about R3.1bn (up from R2.7bn in 2015).It is estimated that about R1.3bn will be derived from subsidies, just over R1.3bn from student fees, R259m from short courses and R224m from other income such as rentals, parking fees and cost recoveries.Some protesting students have called on vice-chancellors to take pay cuts to make more funding available to students. Some vice-chancellors earn more than Zuma, whose salary was just less than R2.9m in 2015. Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib earned R3.3m in 2015, according to the university&rsquo;s annual report.Wits has been the centre of the student protests.Other top-earning vice-chancellors include the University of SA&rsquo;s Mandla Makhanya, who earned R4.2m in 2015; the University of Johannesburg&rsquo;s Ihron Rensburg, who took home R3.7m; and Stellenbosch University&rsquo;s Wim de Villiers, who was paid R2.9m."The Wits vice-chancellor earns around R3m including all bonuses &mdash; one of the lowest among the top universities in the country. He gave up his bonus last year to support needy students. If the VC&rsquo;s [vice-chancellor&rsquo;s] salary is cut, it will have not make a dent in the budgets required to fund the university," Patel says.She believes that free, fully state funded, quality, "decolonised" higher education is possible."We pledge to approach the government with a united voice for the realisation of this goal."We pledge to deploy our intellectual resources towards finding the best solutions. We are also prepared to support peaceful advocacy activities in this regard," she says.University of Cape Town spokesman Elijah Moholola says the institution supports the long-term ideal of free higher education but implementation, coverage, sustainability and macro-economic factors need investigation to develop a coherent policy for the medium term."The issue of fees is a national one and the executive commits to lobbying at national level," Moholola says.Poor StudentsStellenbosch University spokeswoman Susan van der Merwe says the university supports free education for poor students."Ideally, this (free education) should be the case for all students, however, as this is not feasible in the current economic climate without a substantial additional investment from government, universities still require cost-sharing from government grants plus tuition fees from those who can afford to pay," she says."Stellenbosch University supports and follows a differentiated approach, with an emphasis on financial support for academically deserving students from poor and working-class families," Van der Merwe says.Nico Cloete, of the Centre for Higher Education Transformation and University of the Western Cape, says universities are facing a predicament of how to finance the increasing costs in the sector.Cloete says while investment in higher education is beneficial, it is realistic to examine the fee payment framework."Considering the private benefits of (higher education) and the fact that SA has such high graduate employment, the most important fees policy question is: do students pay while at university, or while they are working? I prefer the latter," Cloete says.Co-Pierre Georg, a senior lecturer at the African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management at the University of Cape Town, says loans are unsustainable."Student loans can never work&hellip;. It&rsquo;s a system that was broken from the beginning. What we should learn from the global financial crisis is that student loans are basically bad loans."Treasury budget head Michael Sachs says basic education is constitutionally guaranteed, while further education is a right through reasonable, legitimate measures that the state must make progressively available and accessible.Fiscal sustainability, according to Sachs, means it is not feasible to provide for free or subsidised higher education through further borrowing, since borrowing has already increased from 20% of GDP to 45%. Increased taxation was also not necessarily a solution."There is a complicated relationship between taxation and the size of the economy."You can have a situation where you raise taxes very abruptly, choke off growth and the actual resources you get from that raise in taxation is less than you would have got had you not raised taxes."There are a lot of factors that you have to take into account," he says.
