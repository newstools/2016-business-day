Hours after the announcement of the preferred candidate to be the country’s next inspector-general of intelligence, a picture of Setlomamaru Isaac Dintwe with ANC heavyweights started doing the rounds. The joint standing committee on intelligence will now forward Dintwe’s name to the National Assembly, where he will need a two-thirds majority before being confirmed in the post. Once Dintwe clears that hurdle, his name will be forwarded to President Jacob Zuma for final sign-off. The position has been vacant for 18 months. No sooner had the announcement been made than an image of Dintwe at a dinner, sitting with ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi, surfaced. Dintwe is the former head of the police practice department at the University of SA and was among 10 candidates interviewed for the position. Committee member and ANC MP Doris Dlakude said: "Everything was done in the open. The interviews were held in public and there is nothing that the committee would like to add to the interview process that has unfolded."
