Seoul &mdash; Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday as the strengthening US dollar snuffed out the rekindled hope that oil cartel Opec might agree production cuts.International Brent crude oil futures were trading down 13c at $46.36 a barrel at 4.45am GMT, from their last close.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were trading at $45.19 a barrel, down 23c, or 0.51%, from their last settlement.A stronger US dollar makes oil, which is priced in dollars, more expensive to buyers in other currencies."Oil traded in a sideways range overnight, as stronger US dollar [overshadowed] optimism from Saudi&rsquo;s energy minister over a production cut agreement," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda brokerage in Singapore."With the dollar reigning supreme, Asia trading of crude should have a slightly heavy tone today as traders lighten up positioning into the weekend," Halley said.The US dollar index reached a 13-and-a-half-year high on comments by US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen as she said the rate increase could happen "relatively soon", indicating higher chances of the rate hike in December."Commodities were mixed, with the stronger dollar creating headwinds for the sector. Brent crude oil traded around $46 a barrel as investors saw an increasing chance that Opec would reach an agreement on production cuts," Australian bank ANZ said in a note.Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih&rsquo;s optimistic comments on potential Opec cuts came ahead of a meeting of key oil exporters&rsquo; officials scheduled to take place between on Friday.The oil exporters&rsquo; representatives &mdash; from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Venezuela, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Nigeria &mdash; are meeting in Qatar&rsquo;s capital Doha to discuss details of a potential deal on output cuts."I think [an Opec deal] would have a short-term impact on the market ... production cap could induce [oil producers to] start producing more in the long term if prices go up," said Ric Spooner, a Sydney-based analyst at CMC Markets.Although Saudi Arabia is leading to reach a deal on cutting outputs, Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said the Opec member would finance $2.2bn from a Chinese credit line to boost oil joint ventures with China National Petroleum Corp by about 277,000 barrels a day.Iran&rsquo;s increasing output also casts doubt on whether an Opec deal will be able to clear a persistent global oil glut.
