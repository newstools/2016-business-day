The Mexican Formula One race proved once again that the Mercedes team is the one to beat this season, but it also sees a close battle within the team.Lewis Hamilton closed the gap (now at 19 points) between him and team-mate Nico Rosberg after winning ahead of his team-mate. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull Racing) took third after his team-mate, Max Verstappen, was given a five-second penalty, which saw him demoted to fifth position after out-braking himself on lap 61 of 78, which saw him cut through the grass to regain position ahead of his pursuer, Sebastien Vettel (Ferrari).With only two races to go this season Rosberg stands a good chance of clinching the championship at the next race in Brazil if he finishes at the very least in second spot, but it will not be an easy feat.Sebastien Ogier (Volkswagen Polo R) once again proved his mettle when he won the Wales Great Britain leg of the 2016 WRC (World Rally Championship) season, this following his fourth consecutive driver&rsquo;s championship that was concluded at the race in Spain a few weeks ago. Ott Tanak (Ford Fiesta RS) finished second, while Thierry Neuville (Hyundai i20) was third.The Malaysian GP of the MotoGP championship saw Andrea Dovozioso (Ducati Team) take first ahead of Valentino Rossi (Yamaha Moto GP), while Jorge Lorenzo (Yamaha Moto GP) came third.Locally, it was the final round of the Donaldson Cross Country Championshipd, which saw youth prevail over experience when Jason Venter and Vince van Allemann clinched the Class T title at the Atlas Copco Gold 450 in KwaZulu-Natal.Class T battleThe race was won overall by Zimbabwean Conrad Rautenbach and South African champion Rob Howie (Toyota Gazoo Racing SA Hilux) to preserve a two-year Toyota unbeaten record, but all eyes in the production vehicle category were on the Class T battle between Venter-Van Allemann (4x4 Mega World Toyota Hilux) and the experienced Chris Visser and Ward Huxtable in the Neil Woolridge Motorsport/Ford Performance Ranger.With the overall and Class S title already wrapped up, the fight between youth and experience and privateers versus factory team caught the imagination. The battle was made all the more interesting in that the two crews were level on points going into the decider. Rautenbach-Howie were comfortable winners and Venter-Van Allemann appeared to have the upper hand when they won the qualifying race, to determine grid positions.But Venter and Van Allemann finished behind Rautenbach and Howie to clinch the Class T championship.In other news Audi has killed off the most successful Le Mans racing programme in modern history, shifting its motorsport focus to the burgeoning Formula E category.The German brand will retain its GT customer programme and its domestic DTM tin-top racing team, but will end its involvement in the World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the Le Mans 24 hour classic at the end of 2016. That means the team, which won 13 times in 18 attempts, has already run its last Le Mans 24 Hour, where it also took legendary Danish racer Tom Kristensen to seven of his nine wins at La Sarthe.Le Mans milestonesAudi ushered in many milestones at Le Mans, including the first win for a diesel car, the first win for a hybrid car and has won the WEC twice and the American Le Mans Series nine times in a row from 2000. It has 80 pole positions and 106 wins from 185 starts in the WEC.Audi will now pivot to Formula E and, intriguingly, it floated the prospect of signing on with a full works team if the FIA switches the World Rallycross Championship to battery-electric power. Audi has a toe in the water with Formula E, supporting the Team ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport operation in 2016, but will sign on as a full factory team from the 2017-18 season.&nbsp;
