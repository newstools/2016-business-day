RainFin CEO Sean Emery says Absa&rsquo;s exit will position the peer-to-peer lender to service multiple financial institutions on its platform including asset managers and pension funds.Absa, which bought into RainFin for an undisclosed amount in March 2014, said it would sell its 49% stake back to RainFin&rsquo;s founding shareholders to focus on its core operations.Funding fintech companies remained part of the bank&rsquo;s strategy and it was investing in 10 fintechs across the continent, an Absa spokesperson said."We believe peer-to-peer lending platforms still have potential but if we do it in future, it will be aligned to our strategy," the spokesperson said.RainFin, which is an online lending marketplace that connects borrowers and lenders, was facilitating more than R1m per day in small business loans, Emery said. This accounted for 95% of its lending activity.The loan volume would slow after the Absa exit, but new institutional lenders were in the pipeline and RainFin planned to grow its retail lender base, he said.The company would change its model to take into account new rules requiring all people and entities granting any amount of credit to be registered with the National Credit Regulator.RainFin would expand its loan offering, currently capped at loans below R705,000, to cater to a range of businesses, Emery said. It had also changed its credit scoring methodology to focus more on the balance sheet as opposed to cash-flow only and would introduce secured loans."We now have a corporate and SME credit marketplace where any company, regardless of size, can access a retail and institutional lender base."Mid-sized entities could now secure credit directly from large asset managers or pension funds, which that were entering the marketplace-lending sector with a view to building their own pool of interest-income assets, Emery said."As these asset managers and pension funds get more comfortable with direct exposure to debt, as opposed to participating in banks debt securitisations, we will see the sector explode exponentially," he said.Since Absa s exit, RainFin had to rebuild the business with new customers. "We are on a sharp curve back to profitability," Emery said. He would not say how much RainFin had paid Absa to buy back the equity stake, but said the business s value had risen over the period.
