Hobart &mdash; Steady batting in the face of quality bowling helped Australia fight back on the third day of the second Test against SA on Monday.The home side were 121/2 in their second innings at stumps at Bellerive Oval in Hobart&sbquo; still 120 runs behind but having improved dramatically after being dismissed for 85 in their first innings.Usman Khawaja marshalled Australia&rsquo;s batting with an unbeaten 56.With him was Steve Smith&sbquo; on 18&sbquo; in a partnership of 42.Kyle Abbott had Joe Burns caught behind with a wide delivery down the leg side&sbquo; the fourth ball of the innings.Another legside effort by Abbott hit David Warner&rsquo;s thigh pad. The ball rose&sbquo; found the batsman&rsquo;s elbow and bowled him for 45 to end a stand of 79.SA seemed to be on the verge of running through the Aussies again&sbquo; but Khawaja and Smith stood firm despite many deliveries from Kagiso Rabada and Abbott veering off the seam and screaming past the edge of the bat.Abbott took 2/55 from 14 overs while Rabada conceded 19 in his nine overs.SA, who resumed on 171/5&sbquo; were dismissed 40 minutes after lunch for 326 in reply to Australia&rsquo;s first innings of 85.Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma&sbquo; who joined forces when SA were 132/5&sbquo; added 144 before De Kock was bowled through the gate by Josh Hazlewood for 104.De Kock&rsquo;s effort was his second century in his 18 Test innings and marked the fifth consecutive time he had gone past 50.Nine balls after lunch Bavuma was hurried into his stoke by Joe Mennie and spooned a catch to point for the debutant to claim his maiden test wicket.Vernon Philander&rsquo;s 32&sbquo; off 28 balls with six fours&sbquo; was the best of the rest of SA&rsquo;s batting.TMG Digital
