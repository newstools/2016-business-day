Tshwane plans to install 3,000 water restrictors to keep reckless users in check, mayor Solly Msimanga announced on Tuesday. The recent rain had not put a dent in the country’s three-year drought, Msimanga said in a briefing on Tuesday at Pretoria’s Rietvlei Dam Nature Reserve — one of the city’s key water sources. He said although residents were using 15.8% less water — a bigger saving than was required — there were still reckless water users. Msimanga said 40 people had been fined‚ mainly in the affluent Pretoria East suburbs, and Laudium and Centurion. The city would install 3,000 water flow restrictors to throttle the supply to households and neighbourhoods with a high water demand. Tshwane water and sanitation department head Stephens Notoane said these areas included Waverley‚ Atteridgeville‚ Shoshanguve‚ Lotus Gardens‚ and Garsfontein. ". .. People [are] continuously filling their swimming pools. People [are] continuously watering their gardens during the course of the day. One golf course,... during the course of the day, just continuously waters the whole golf course. Those are the people we have identified that we have given notices to," he said. Msimanga said a notice had also been issued to a contractor for damaging water pipes and failing to report the damage‚ leading to the loss of water. He said "anyone digging in our city will now have to pay a R200,000 holding deposit" as Tshwane could not afford to keep paying for damage caused by contractors. Tshwane has 165 reservoirs which provide the city with 950-million litres of water every day. Of these, 90% are more than 70% full, but three are below 50%. Msimanga urged Tshwane residents to continue saving as much water as they could and to use grey water where possible. TMG Digital
