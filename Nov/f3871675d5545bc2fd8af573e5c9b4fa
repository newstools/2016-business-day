Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani allegedly threw a microphone at ANC spokesman Gift Ngqondi in a radio debate on KQFM on Monday night. It happened in a heated panel discussion of the council decision to stop account holders buying more electricity until their accounts were paid up. Ngqondi said: "He (Bobani) threw a microphone at me and pushed his finger in my face. He did that in full view of the panel. They were shocked by his behaviour. "I decided to remain calm because as the ANC we are viewed as violent‚ but a deputy mayor can’t behave like that‚" he said. Ngqondi said he would open a criminal case on Tuesday morning. But Bobani said: "That is not true. Go look at the studio microphone and see if it is broken. He just wants publicity. Maybe Gift does not have enough Facebook followers. He must go and open a case. I am waiting." Bobani said the debate was peaceful. "He just wants publicity. Why did he announce this on Facebook before even opening a criminal case?" Bobani said. But two other councillors who took part in the debate backed Ngqondi’s version of events. EFF councillor Yoliswa Yako said Bobani threw a microphone at Ngqondi. "We were debating the electricity cuts and the deputy mayor kept on shouting. He was condescending and did not listen to anyone. He then pushed the microphone forcefully at the ANC guy. "It was shocking. If Gift had not been calm I don’t know what would have happened," said Yako. United Front councillor Mkhuseli Mtsila said: "There was drama. Things turned violent. The deputy mayor pushed the microphone forcefully at Gift and pushed his finger in his face. "It was very unpleasant to watch. A public Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobanirepresentative behaving like that? He was there representing the metro," said Mtsila Attempts to reach KQFM presenter Percy Lamani were unsuccessful. TMG Digital
