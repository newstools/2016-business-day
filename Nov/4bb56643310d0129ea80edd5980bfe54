Adelaide &mdash; Faf du Plessis has been cleared to play in the third Test between SA and Australia in Adelaide on Thursday, despite being found guilty of ball-tampering.The South African captain was found to have illegally changed the condition of the ball during the second Test in Hobart.He was fined 100% of his match fee and docked three demerit points &mdash; one short of what would have earned him a ban for Thursday&rsquo;s game.The decision was taken by match referee Andy Pycroft after a hearing in Adelaide on Tuesday.Du Plessis&rsquo;s fate marked the third time since 2012 that South Africans have been found to violate one of cricket&rsquo;s most sacred tenets&sbquo; which is also among its most often transgressed.Video footage showed Du Plessis slathering saliva on the ball using his fingers&sbquo; which he had taken from his mouth &mdash; in which an object that could have been a sweet or a mint was visible.The International Cricket Council pointed out that if Du&nbsp;Plessis &ldquo;reaches four or more demerit points within a 24-month period&sbquo; they will be converted into suspension points and he will be banned&rdquo;.&ldquo;Two suspension points equate to a ban from one test or two one-day internationals or two T20 internationals&sbquo; whatever comes first for the player.&rdquo;Du Plessis has 48 hours from receipt of the written version of Pycroft&rsquo;s decision to lodge an appeal.TMG Digital
