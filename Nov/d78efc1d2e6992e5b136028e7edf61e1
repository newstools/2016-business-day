Cabinet has approved a suite of policies aimed at strengthening state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as well as the release of the draft integrated energy plan and the integrated resource plan for public discussion. Among the policies adopted were a private sector participation framework for infrastructure delivery, which will guide collaboration between SOEs and the private sector, and guidelines for the remuneration and incentive standards for directors of SOEs. Also approved was a broad guide for the appointment of boards and executive officers of SOEs about which the Department of Public Service and Administration will consult provinces and municipalities, before it is finally approved by Cabinet. Cabinet said in a statement on Thursday that the first draft of a new government shareholder policy was recommended for further consultation. This would culminate in the promulgation of overarching legislation for SOEs. The statement also noted that the Treasury had developed a proposal for determining and costing developmental mandates of SOEs and said the introduction of this approach would help to streamline commercial and noncommercial activities of SOEs. Eskom has been designated as the owner operator and procurer for nuclear power plants and the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation as the owner operator and procurer for nuclear fuel cycle and multi-purpose reactor. Cabinet also approved the introduction of the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill in Parliament to provide for the payment of compensation for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of motor vehicles.
