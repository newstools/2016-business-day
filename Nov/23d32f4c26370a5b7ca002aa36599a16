The rand was relatively well supported on Wednesday morning, looking as though it could strengthen through R14/$ for the first since in about two weeks.The local currency drew support from the generalised global risk appetite, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average cross the 19,000-point mark for the first time.The government&rsquo;s decision to delay the nuclear power expansion, which is seen as a drag on already tight state finances, has been viewed in a positive light just days before rating agencies review their decisions on the country&rsquo;s credit rating.Moody&rsquo;s will hand down its decision on Friday, while S&amp;P Global Ratings&rsquo; decision is expected on December 2."The rand is certainly flexing its muscles as once again we saw gains of over 20c yesterday despite the dollar remaining strong," said Wichard Cilliers, head of dealing and a director at TreasuryOne.The rand has strengthened 3% against the greenback since the start of the week, boding well for the inflation outlook. It has also firmed against the euro and pound this week.At 9.15am, the rand was at R14.0283 to the dollar from Tuesday&rsquo;s R14.0283. It was at R14.9240 to the euro from R14.9437 and R17.4065 to the pound from R17.4592The euro was at $1.0638, from $1.0628.
