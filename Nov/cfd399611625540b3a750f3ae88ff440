Harmony Gold cut its net debt by half to R528m in the first quarter of its 2017 financial year after generating R850m worth of free operational cash flow. Harmony and other gold producers have been in a sweet spot in 2016, thanks to the higher rand gold price. The R19bn gold producer was able to swing back to profitability earlier in 2016 and declared a dividend for the first time since 2012. The increase in the price of gold, as a result of investors seeking a safe haven, resulted in the market capitalisation of gold companies increasing by R137.6bn since June 2015, according to a PwC SA Mine report released in October. Share prices of most mining companies have re-rated markedly since the second half of 2015, tracking the pick-up in commodity prices that provided a kicker to their financial performance. "We had a very good start to the new financial year, with increased production, even stronger cash flows and a quarter in which we returned money to shareholders by way of a dividend," Peter Steenkamp said on Thursday in its September quarterly production report. Gold output rose 10% to 8,630/kg on a quarter-on-quarter basis, with revenue lifting 9% to a record quarterly revenue of R5.25bn. The all-in sustaining cost was stable with a 1% decrease to R516,116/kg. Harmony, which recently acquired the other half of the Hidden Valley mine in Papua New Guinea, said it continued to explore opportunities to increase production and reserves at the mine. The mine has the potential to contribute about 180,000 ounces of gold per annum to at an all-in sustaining cost of less than $950/oz once fully recommissioned. Harmony settled 0.3% higher to R43 on the JSE on Thursday. The stock has risen nearly fourfold this year.
