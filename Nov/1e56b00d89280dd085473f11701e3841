International credit ratings agencies began meetings with government and political leaders this week.On Thursday they spoke to politicians at the ANC headquarters, Luthuli House.SA&rsquo;s credit rating, currently at investment grade, runs the risk of being downgraded to junk status because of weak economic growth, poorly performing state-owned enterprises putting a drag on the fiscus, and high state debt.Junk status increases the cost of borrowing and may lead to disinvestment.Moody&rsquo;s Issuer Services will publish its ratings action first &mdash; on black Friday, November 25.S&amp;P Global Ratings will follow on December 2. Fitch Ratings has not yet indicated when its report will be issued.Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile is expected to meet S&amp;P at the weekend, having already sat for meetings with Fitch Ratings.Fuzile said on Thursday issues of corruption in the government had not been directly raised by ratings agencies. "They care about fiscal policy issues: will we achieve our growth target, and what is our plan if there s a shock [to the fiscus]?"It is understood that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has met with Fitch but not S&amp;P."One of the things they say, which is very encouraging, is that they place a very high premium on the strength of institutions in SA," Fuzile said.However, the ratings agencies also wanted reassurances that government institutions would stay intact.Recent upheavals over fraud charges against the finance minister and two former South African Revenue Service officials, which were later withdrawn, and findings on state capture had not made it tougher to convince ratings agencies, Fuzile said. "They can see that notwithstanding everything that happens, the system works ."But the questions linger only because people would feel if there weren t noises things would be smoother and perhaps better," he said.
