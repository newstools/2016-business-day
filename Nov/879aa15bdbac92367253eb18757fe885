Lonmin narrowed its full-year loss despite a fall in revenue related to lower average platinum group metal prices, which offset increased platinum sales coming from a one-off boost in available metal. Lonmin sold 735,747oz of platinum in the year to the end of September, well ahead of its target 700,000oz due to the metal it cleared out of its processing plant. The company forecast sales would drop to between 650,000oz and 680,000oz in the year ahead as it shut old mines and focused on profitable operations, said CE Ben Magara. Lonmin had laid off 5,433 employees by the end of March without a labour stoppage and secured a fresh three-year wage deal without a strike, but the unsettled nature of the work environment after the restructuring had negatively affected productivity, he said. The clean-out of the smelters and the start of the Other Precious Metals Plant generated 73,186oz, offsetting the nearly 9% fall in mined output for the year, mostly because of declining production from older shafts being wound down. Revenue fell by $175m from a year ago to $1.12bn because of the lower platinum price. The average price for the basket of metals Lonmin produced fell to $796/oz from $902/oz before. Lonminâ€™s full-year loss was $400m compared with $1.9bn a year earlier. Costs were kept to R10,748/oz during the year, a 4% increase. Looking ahead, however, the costs were forecast to rise to R10,800-R11,300 per platinum group metal ounce in the year ahead. The forecast of R1.8bn earmarked for capital expenditure in the year to the end of September 2017 and the increase in cost expectations against lower production meant Lonmin would have negative cash flow next year, said an analyst. Lonmin recorded a $335m impairment against its assets because of the low rhodium price and a stronger rand versus the dollar in the second half.
