EFF leader Julius Malema is applying to the High Court to have the Riotous Assemblies Actâ€š under which he is being charged, declared unconstitutional. Malema appeared briefly in the Newcastle Regional Court on Monday on charges relating to comments he made about land occupation. He was being charged with contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 and Trespass Act of 1959. His lawyer Tumi Mokwena, asked the court to postpone the matter for six months pending the outcome of the High Court application. Malema was supported by other EFF leaders, including deputy president Floyd Shivambu, secretary general Godrich Gardee and spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Magistrate Theunis Colditz agreed to postpone the matter to May 5, 2017. It was also agreed that Malema would have until December 7 2016 to prove that he had lodged the application with the High Court. The EFF has claimed that the state was using old apartheid-style tactics against Malema for a political speech he gave. Malema made the land occupation comments at a rally held at Madadeni in Newcastle, northern KwaZulu-Natal, on June 26 2016. He was also due to appear in the Bloemfontein Regional Court next Monday for similar comments he made in Mangaung in the Free State on December 16 2014.
