Two Tour de France legends are to team up for the 2017 edition of the Absa Cape Epic mountain bike race. Australian Cadel Evans is to ride the gruelling eight-day Epic in the mountains of the Western Cape with George Hincapie of the US. The pair are to compete in the masters category in March’s race, considered to be one of the world’s toughest off-road bike races. Evans won the Tour de France in 2011 after two runners-up spots, while Hincapie completed the Tour 17 times. Both have retired from competitive road racing but have kept in shape and will be contenders in their category, as well as big attractions, at the Epic. "Ever since I first heard about the Cape Epic I have wanted to try it. But they tell me it’s very hard," said Evans, 40, who started his career as a mountain biker and won the World Cup in 1998 and 1999. Hincapie, 43, won three US national road race championships in his 19-year career and rode in all the European classics. Asked why he had chosen to do the Epic, Hincapie said: "Cadel made me do it … and it looks like it’s going to be an amazing adventure." The 2017 Epic, which starts at the Meerendaal wine estate, takes place from March 19-26.
