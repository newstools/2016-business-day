Adelaide &mdash; Ugly scenes occurred on SA&rsquo;s trip to Adelaide on Monday&sbquo; when South African security staff manhandled reporters who were deemed too aggressive in their attempts to obtain comment from Faf du Plessis on the ball-tampering charges he faces.But Du Plessis seems likely to have the last laugh&sbquo; at least on this tour: it appears the charges will be heard only after the third Test&sbquo; which starts on Thursday.That would make Du Plessis safe from the prospect of being banned for the match&sbquo; which could be his punishment if he is found guilty.The charges were laid after television footage emerged after the second Test in Hobart showing Du Plessis polishing the ball using saliva fetched from his mouth &mdash; in which what appears to be a sweet or mint is clearly visible.Security staff intervened when Du Plessis was accosted by reporters outside the squad hotel in Melbourne at the weekend &mdash; against the express wishes of team management.More drama unfolded when the squad arrived in Adelaide.Team officials told the waiting reporters that no questions could be asked of the South African players as they moved through the airport&sbquo; but the request was ignored.Du Plessis&sbquo; in sunglasses and headphones&sbquo; had ignored three questions, team management said, when a reporter thrust a microphone in his face.This was apparently interpreted as a security breach by the squad&rsquo;s travelling protection officer&sbquo; Zunaid Wadee &mdash; who can be seen in the footage shoving and shoulder-charging the reporter away.Other footage showed South African team manager Mohammed Moosajee appearing to try and shield Du Plessis from an advancing reporter by walking into the space between them. The reporter then shoved Moosajee in the back.After the incident Hashim Amla who voiced a passionate defence of Du Plessis in Melbourne on Friday posted on social media: "Disappointed. Such provocative behaviour from reporters. Let a man walk in peace. Ask with manners and courtesy and you probably will get a response."All of which could prompt the International Cricket Council (ICC) to delay the hearing until after the third Test and once the South Africans have left Australia.In any event the fact that a lawyer has been summoned from SA and the resultant complications with obtaining a visa at short notice could push the hearing beyond Thursday.TMG Sport
