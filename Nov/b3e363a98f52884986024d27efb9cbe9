Burkina Faso played themselves right back into World Cup contention and actually sit above SA on goal difference in Group D after a 2-0 win in the Cape Verde Islands at the weekend that coach Paulo Duarte said proved they could qualify for Russia in 2018. A goal after just two minutes from Banou Diawara‚ who had scored the last-gasp equaliser against Bafana Bafana in Ouagadougou in October‚ set the Stallions on their way to an unexpected three-point haul. Speedy winger Prejuce Nakoulma‚ who gave Bafana a torrid time in October‚ got the second goal for Burkina just before the half-hour mark. "This win showed that our draw with SA was not a fair result. We should have won by at least three goals. We know that we have a good squad and that we had to do the business away from home. Our side were feeling negative after the SA match but bounced back well," said Duarte. TMG Digital
