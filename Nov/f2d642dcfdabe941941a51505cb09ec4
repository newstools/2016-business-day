Millions of years ago, the earth&rsquo;s gurgling mantle gave rise to nine small islands in the middle of the North Atlantic. Today, the Azores is a quiet realm of Iberian charm and dazzling vine-draped greens carved out by a dramatic history of volcanic events.The islands, an autonomous region of Portugal, offer gorgeous no-filter landscapes and remain remarkably under the tourist radar. But things are about to change.The newly rebranded Azores Airlines is raising its connections to major European cities next year; in theory, the carrier&rsquo;s affordable airfares should drive interest in an Azores stopover.The plan is to operate 972 flights next year (up 46% from 2016) connecting US passengers from Boston, Oakland and Rhode Island to destinations such as Lisbon, Porto, Barcelona, Praia (Cape Verde), London and Frankfurt. The new route from Boston to Barcelona, for example, will start at $549, including taxes.The Azores is hoping to find the sweet spot that boosts infrastructure without damaging the treasures that make the archipelago so unique.The nine isles of the Azores are organised into three geographic clusters east, central and west with the most populous (and most accessible) island, S o Miguel, belonging to the eastern group.You ll need a puddle jumper to leap between islands, though public ferries will easily get you around each cluster. Give yourself time to explore some of the outlying islands beyond S o Miguel a week is ideal.On S o Miguel island, start at Sete Cidades, known as one of Portugal s seven wonders (and readily endorsed as such by the flight attendants over the loudspeaker when you land).Follow their lead and check out the two lagoons one blue and one emerald as they swirl together in the pit of a crater. Hikers glide around the caldera s perimeter, while others enjoy paddling in the waters below.A stop in the aptly named village of Furnas is another must. Surrounded by steaming, scorched earth, the area has been a sought-after spa destination for more than 300 years.There you can bathe in the brackish waters of Terra Nostra Garden &mdash; a cauldron of minerals and metals that refresh the skin. And don&rsquo;t leave the area without trying cozido, an Azorean stew-like version of paella cooked in mud-pots over volcanic heat.The bustle in Ponta Delgada, the island&rsquo;s main municipality, belies its small population of about 70,000. It&rsquo;s the largest community in the Azores and the seat of government, and is home to the archipelago&rsquo;s biggest airport.With a unique style of religious architecture sculpted from porous volcanic stone, the capital city&rsquo;s colonial downtown area is best enjoyed in the evening with a walk among the twisting back streets, or tapas along the waterfront.Vibrant street art abounds &mdash; it&rsquo;s all sponsored by the cultural nonprofit Walk &amp; Talk Azores &mdash; adding vibrancy to the black-and-white colonial dwellings.If you can only get to one of the outer islets, prioritise Pico. It&rsquo;s a powerful counterpoint to S&atilde;o Miguel, with about a tenth of the population and a soaring volcanic peak whose shadow moves across the landscape like a sundial.Climbing Pico&rsquo;s summit remains the island&rsquo;s most iconic experience &mdash; a trek that takes about six hours to the top and back &mdash; but there are plenty of other activities that make the destination worth visiting.In the 19th century, Pico was one of Europe&rsquo;s great wine producers, serving the aristocracy with a tangy pour found nowhere else on the continent. And although the wine blight all but obliterated the industry in the 1850s, it&rsquo;s bouncing back.The island has maintained an adega &mdash; or cellar &mdash; culture where visitors can taste fortified tipples and buy a few bottles. Locals readily endorse Adega A Buraca, where you can play with 19th-century vintner&rsquo;s tools and test their wares.Pico is also an excellent place for whale watching, as it is a transatlantic meeting point for countless species of marine mammals. The season runs from April to October, limited only by rougher seas in the colder months.Espa&ccedil;o Talassa, established in the late 1980s as an observation base, provides three-hour excursions at sea; its guests often see multiple types of ocean dwellers, from sperm whales to bottlenose dolphins.You&rsquo;ll want to focus the bulk of your trip on S&atilde;o Miguel, where you&rsquo;ll find a new crop of high-end hotels. All have conservative room counts, international service standards, locally sourced design and a general sense of sustainability.For Ponta Delgada urban life, try the Azor Hotel, which opened in June to fill the palpable void of sleek boutique stays. Rooms are tastefully appointed with a less-is-more design ethos: blonde wood, crisp white linens and floor-to-ceiling views of the harbour.Azor&rsquo;s sister property, Furnas Boutique Hotel, is about a 45-minute drive away, in a lush jungle setting. Both have great restaurants and design, but the latter caters more to spa-goers &mdash; it has a huge network of thermal pools and aromatic showers that are fed by the local hot springs.For something resembling more of a traditional beach holiday, check into Santa Barbara Eco-Beach Resort, a collection of semidetached suites along S&atilde;o Miguel&rsquo;s northern coast.Slabs of poured concrete sprout up from the polished floors, forming sculptural beds and sofas that mimic the black-sand beaches and undulating coastline outside.Outside of the main island, do as the locals do and concentrate your search on Airbnb (or with local villa rental companies.)You&rsquo;ll have a hard time finding a bad meal in the Azores. The fish always comes straight out of the water no matter where you go, and is best enjoyed with a starter plate of freshly baked bread and cheese from the island of S&atilde;o Jorge.Wash it down with a briny, slightly effervescent glass of verdelho, and you&rsquo;ve got yourself the perfect lunch &mdash; the main meal of the day in the Azores. This basic, delicious meal can be found in practically every eating establishment, from high-end hotel lounges to hole-in-the-wall haunts full of fishermen.These kinds of casual, no-need-to-plan-ahead meals will sustain you on your adventure &mdash; but at night, make reservations at either of the two best restaurants in the archipelago.On S&atilde;o Miguel, there&rsquo;s Anfiteatro, the test kitchen for the archipelago&rsquo;s only culinary school, with 84 seats hidden under an imposing concrete staircase of Niemeyer-esque proportions. The restaurant showcases ingredients from across the islands on its four-and seven-course menus.On a recent visit, we loved the octopus prepared with crisped mountain yam and buttery "O Morro" cheese from a local producer.On Faial Island, search the back streets of the old port village of Horta for Restaurante Genuino. There, the catch of the day is expertly prepared in Azorean fashion: slightly undercooked and unmarred by excessive spices.A conservative smattering of salt, pepper and olive oil is all that&rsquo;s needed to really let the fresh flavours sing. The fish is all caught by the namesake owner, a sailing prodigy who has circumnavigated the globe twice &mdash; both times on solo expeditions.If making the trek out to this little island hasn&rsquo;t already inspired you to follow in his footsteps, the restaurant&rsquo;s d&eacute;cor &mdash; seashells from Tahiti, Balinese masks and postcards from Mauritius that Genuino collected along his journeys &mdash; will certainly do the trick.Bloomberg
