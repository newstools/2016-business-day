South African bonds were steady at midday on Wednesday after consumer inflation for October came in higher than expected. Inflation was recorded at 6.4% year on year from 6.1% in September, above market expectations for a rise of 6.3%. The higher number was driven by increases in food and petrol prices. At 11.35am the R186 was bid at 8.930% from 8.950% and the R207 was bid at 8.165% from 8.160%. Analysts said the bond market adopted a forward looking view on inflation and the higher level was unlikely to lead to interest rate hikes. The Reserve Bank will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday. "Although South African consumer inflation was expected to move noticeably higher over the next two months, it is expected to fall firmly back into the target range of 3% to 6% during the first half of 2017," said Stanlib economist Kevin Lings. Excluding food and petrol inflation was still within the target band at 5.8%. The rand was earlier supported by the news that there could be a delay in the nuclear energy programme, but the currency weakened following the release of the inflation data. The yield on the US 10-year treasury was last at 2.2923% from 2.3145%. Europe, Middle East and Africa high-yield bond issuance slipped a monthly 72% in October as markets held their breath in the run up to the US election in early-November, rating agency Moodyâ€™s said in an update released on Wednesday.
