SA will be unable to diversify its export base and achieve growth unless it improves the quality of its education, a leading economist has warned.Professor Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and author of The End of Poverty, said: &quot;[Education] is the most important determinant of future economic growth. Without a bigger skills base, SA will remain dependent on commodities,&quot; Sachs said at the Old Mutual Corporate Wisdom Forum.Quoting a 2007 World Bank study, Sachs said the quality of education, rather than years spent in school, had the greatest effect on growth.A large share of SA&#8217;s budget is committed to education, however this investment is not matched by outcomes.SA needed school principals with the requisite expertise; it needed to confront the South African Democratic Teachers Union, which had too much power over appointments; and it needed to reintroduce school inspectors, said JP Landman, who had been economic adviser for the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for SA.Electricity was equally important to development, Sachs said, and called on the finance industry to invest in infrastructure across Africa. &quot;There is no escape from poverty without mass electrification.&quot;The job of the finance sector is to build tomorrow&#8217;s economy and to help shift long-term savings into long-term investments that can really make a big difference in the lives of people in the years ahead,&quot; he said.SA also needed better governance to keep capital in the country, Sachs said. Globalisation made the cost of poor governance much worse because capital investment simply found a home elsewhere, he said.
