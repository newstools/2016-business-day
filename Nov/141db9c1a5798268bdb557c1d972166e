The week ahead will be dominated by the possibility of SA losing its investment grade credit rating after a fraught year characterised by low growth and a sustained political assault on the Treasury.The scheduled ratings review by S&amp;P Global Ratings is expected late on Friday, but the spectre of a downgrade is likely to weigh on financial markets all week. Both Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P have SA&rsquo;s foreign currency rating pegged at "BBB-" on the bottom rung of the investment grade ladder.S&amp;P has had SA on a "negative" outlook for the past year. One more move and SA will lose its investment-grade rating with S&amp;P altogether.Market pricing of a ratings downgrade to junk has eased to about 50% in recent weeks, from as high as 70% earlier in 2016, ostensibly on lower political risk after fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were withdrawn.And yet S&amp;P has warned SA faces a possibility of losing its investment grade rating unless it cuts through the political noise and implements urgent structural reforms to raise the growth rate.By S&amp;P s reckoning, SA is already junk-rated in terms of its GDP growth performance and GDP per capita income.The only thing keeping SA from being thrown to the wolves has been the Treasury s adherence to the expenditure ceiling and its drive, with business, to expedite structural reforms to put the country on a faster growth path.Structural MeasuresIn June, S&amp;P listed four structural measures that were needed to allow SA to hold onto its investment-grade rating.The country needed a reliable energy supply; labour market reform to reduce damaging strikes and raise youth employment; clarity on the minerals regime; and a reduction in infighting and interference in state institutions.SA has made progress on only the first two items.A number of economists think S&amp;P will give SA another reprieve. "I think perhaps we can dodge the bullet," said BNP Paribas Securities economist Jeffrey Schultz. "It s going to be a close call though."Counting in SA s favour, he said, was that broad agreement has been reached on a labour stability package and SA has a new energy mix plan that puts nuclear on the backburner for another seven years.Added to this was the relatively sound medium-term budget and the fact that SA has avoided strikes in platinum. If SA loses its investment grade rating, it is likely to trigger capital ouflows, rand weakness, higher inflation and interest rates and rising bond yields. This would raise the cost of investment for both the public and private sectors.
