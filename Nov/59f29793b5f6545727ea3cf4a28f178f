The spectre of Reneilwe "Yeye" Letsholonyane looms large as Kaizer Chiefs prepare to host SuperSport United in a Premier League encounter that is set to be peppered with delicious tension at Soccer City on Wednesday night. Letsholonyane is playing some of the best football of his life at United. In perhaps one of football’s delectable ironies‚ his former employers Chiefs, who decided against renewing his contract in May, have continued to struggle, while his star has shone since his departure. The midfielder’s name was bound to come up at Naturena as Chiefs prepare to host a side from United teeming with many of their former players. Midfielder George Maluleka conceded that they had been watching Letsholonyane with a little more than a passing interest and they expected a difficult evening at Soccer City.  "It is going to be the same as when I was still at Ajax Cape Town or SuperSport United and playing against him [when Letsholonyane was at Chiefs]‚" Maluleka said. "Yeye is a quality player and I will never take anything away from him. At the moment, he is on form. "If we have the togetherness… we have a very good chance. But Yeye is not playing alone, he has his own soldiers rallying behind him." United have a Chiefs feel about them. There was a time last season when AmaKhosi manager Bobby Motaung warned Stuart Baxter, a former Chiefs coach, to stay away from his players. Besides Baxter and Letsholonyane‚ the other former Chiefs employees are centre back Morgan Gould‚ left back Keegan Ritchie‚ goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse and defender Tefu Mashamaite‚ who joined United in September after a season at Swedish club BK Hacken. He was the fifth player with whom Baxter had won league and cup doubles at Chiefs, in 2012-13 and 2014-15. Chiefs are coming off a 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns at the weekend. TMG Digital
