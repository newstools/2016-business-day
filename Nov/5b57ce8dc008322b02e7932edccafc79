Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has confirmed having referred her predecessor’s report into state capture to both the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority, in line with the recommendations, the DA said on Sunday. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement he had also received assurances from the Hawks on Sunday that an investigation connected to the corruption charges laid against President Jacob Zuma was receiving attention. Both the DA and the EFF have indicated that they will oppose vigorously the Presidency’s bid for a legal review of the recommendations of the state of capture report. Papers were expected to be filed this week ahead of the Friday deadline for Zuma to establish a judicial commission of inquiry. Mkhwebane confirmed on Saturday that she had laid a criminal charge against Thuli Madonsela following a complaint from Zuma over a leaked audio tape of an interview during the state capture probe. The Sunday Times reported Mkhwebane as saying she had opened the case at Brooklyn police station in Pretoria on November 11. Madonsela, who was not in SA and could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday, has admitted to giving the audiotape of her interview with Zuma to news channel eNCA. The recording was released after Madonsela rejected complaints from Zuma that he had not been given time to give his side of the story. Mkhwebane said she went ahead and filed a case with the police because she believed handing over the audiotape had been in contravention of the Public Protector Act. DA justice spokeswoman Glynnis Breytenbach said on Sunday the move by Mkhwebane was a sign that she was acting to protect Zuma. "While Zuma has every right to lodge a grievance with the PP, it is telling that Ms Mkhwebane jumped straight to criminal charges, without conducting any further investigation," she said, adding that Zuma was perfectly capable of laying the charge himself.
