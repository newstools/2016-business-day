The major opposition party has rounded on the ANC following reports of deep divisions over a move to have President Jacob Zuma removed from office.The ANC is set to make an announcement "on the outcomes of the meeting of the national executive committee" on Tuesday&sbquo; a terse statement said on Monday night.That meeting&sbquo; originally scheduled to run until Sunday&sbquo; was extended until late on Monday after Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom tabled a motion of no confidence in Zuma.DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted on Tuesday morning: "Whatever the outcome of #ANCNEC deep divisions are there. Ours is to rally behind the 94 consensus of constitutionalism and prosperity 4 all".The party&rsquo;s chief whip in the National Assembly&sbquo; John Steenhuisen&sbquo; had some advice for the anti-Zuma camp: "If those in the ANC really want to get rid of Zuma only 52 of them need to break ranks in the house for a motion of no confidence to pass!"The DA tried earlier this month to unseat Zuma in Parliament but its motion of no confidence failed.The Times has learned that some senior anti-Zuma NEC members were told to leave the meeting&sbquo; and sources have said that former national police commissioner Bheki Cele and former police minister Nathi Mthwetwa&sbquo; who are in Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet in other positions&sbquo; nearly exchanged blows at the meeting on Sunday.Hanekom was reported to have been harshly criticised by Zuma sympathisers&sbquo; with some expressing their views on social media.Party insiders said Hanekom&rsquo;s motion was strongly opposed&sbquo; placing his position in Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet in peril.One source said that among senior ANC members who were told by others to resign from the Cabinet and Parliament were Hanekom&sbquo; Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi&sbquo; Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor&sbquo; Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi&sbquo; ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.TMG Digital&nbsp;
