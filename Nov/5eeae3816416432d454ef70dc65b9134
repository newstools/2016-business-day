The South African bond market was slightly weaker on Friday morning, with the yield on the benchmark R186 creeping above the 9% as the rand reeled in the face of a resurgent dollar.The renewed pressure on the local market was due to comments made by US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen in her testimony to the US congress. She said an interest rate increase in the world&rsquo;s largest economy was imminent."It&rsquo;s going to be a bumpy ride for the markets in the next few weeks leading up to the decisions by ratings agencies and the Fed meeting in December," ETM Analytics market analyst Ricardo da Camara said.Moody&rsquo;s and S&amp;P Global Ratings will review their decisions on SA&rsquo;s crediting rating on November 27 and December 2, respectively.The yield on the R186 was at 9.040% in early trade, from 8.990% on Thursday.The US 10-year note, which is at the centre of market focus, steepened to 2.3351% on Friday morning from 2.2225% on Thursday.
