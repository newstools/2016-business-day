The government was working hard to improve its international ranking in terms of the ease of doing business in the country, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said on Thursday.Hurdles to setting up a business &mdash; whether it be a company registration, restrictive labour laws, excessive red tape or immigration regulations &mdash; have long been identified as one of the deterrents to foreign investors.Davies said the government was committed to improving the investment climate and the ease of doing business to enhance SA&rsquo;s status as an internationally competitive investment location.It planned to reform its business processes to improve the country&rsquo;s rankings.SA was ranked 72 among 89 countries in the 2016 World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business Report and 74 out of 190 countries in the 2017 report.The country fared well in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness index 2016-17, ranking 47th out of 138 countries. It was ranked first in the index for financing through local equity markets, the strength of its auditing and reporting standards and the protection of the interests of minority shareholders&rsquo;; second in terms of the soundness of its banks; and third for the regulation of securities exchanges and the efficacy of corporate boards.Davies said in a written response to a parliamentary question by DA spokesman on trade and industry Geordin Hill-Lewis that Investment SA &mdash; a division in the Department of Trade and Industry &mdash; and the Treasury had formalised a relationship with the World Bank. They had also arranged workshops with government departments and agencies to understand the World Bank&rsquo;s methodology and criteria.Investment SA was working on a memorandum on the indicators used to assess the ease-of -doing-business. Over the years, the Doing Business Report had evolved with new countries being added and changes made to the methodology and criteria used. The 2017 report expanded the indicator for the payment of taxes to cover postfiling processes, tax audits, tax refunds and tax appeals. It also added a gender component to three indicators, namely starting a business, registering property and enforcing contracts.Davies said the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission had made strides in easing and expediting the process of company registration.Registrations for South African companies with a maximum of three directors could now be done within a day compared with the previous 5-7 days, while foreign company registrations could be finalised in 5-7 days compared with the previous 21 working days.
