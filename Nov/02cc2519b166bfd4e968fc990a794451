Cosatu is in a fix. As it meets for a three-day central executive committee meeting this week, two of its affiliates &mdash; its largest and the other among its smallest &mdash; have called on President Jacob Zuma to resign.At the same time, Cosatu affiliates have been chastised by the ANC for wading into the party&rsquo;s succession debate, which has already deeply divided the governing party.Cosatu&rsquo;s conundrum is this: if it does not make its own position clear on ANC succession, its affiliates are able to make announcements about their preferences and Cosatu risks losing face among workers who are pushing this position within its allied unions.If the federation does come out and back a candidate, it will be viewed as interfering in already hostile succession terrain in the ANC.A number of factors are influencing the debate within the federation.The South African Communist Party has significant influence in a number of Cosatu affiliates. The negative effect of this influence was felt when the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) and former general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi were expelled.Another factor is the proximity of affiliates to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe on the one hand, and the proximity of individual leaders such as its president, Sdumo Dlamini, to Zuma.When Cosatu examined the cause of the ANC&rsquo;s eight percentage point electoral decline following the local elections in August, many affiliates &mdash; including some former hard line Zuma supporters &mdash; were clear that he was at the heart of the party&rsquo;s falling electoral fortunes.Many felt that the ANC&rsquo;s decision to place Zuma at the centre of its election campaign was a mistake, particularly after the scathing Constitutional Court judg ment on Nkandla delivered just before the polls.Other factors reinforcing this sentiment are the charging of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the subsequent dropping of the charges, and the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s state-capture report.It culminated in the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union, Cosatu s largest affiliate, declaring on November1 that it was time for Zuma to step down and for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over.The Communication Workers Union, a small affiliate but one that has voting rights at the central executive committee meeting, made the same call on Thursday.While most Cosatu affiliates support Ramaphosa to take over from Zuma in 2017, the big debate in this week s committee meeting will be whether the federation should call on Zuma to step aside and whether it should endorse Ramaphosa openly.A number of affiliates now say that the situation in 2016 is worse than what the ANC and its allies faced in 2007, when Cosatu backed Zuma against former president Thabo Mbeki.T he federation s involvement in ANC politics had caused deep divisions, which weakened it considerably and led to the fracturing of many of its affiliates. T he question this week is whether it is willing to do so again.Zuma supporters including the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, admit that they are at a numerical disadvantage, but the federation faces a much more complex situation: it either wades into the ANC s succession race or watches from the sidelines.All the while, waiting in the wings is a new federation spearheaded by Vavi and Numsa, ready to pick up the support of workers disillusioned by Cosatu s complacence in the face of the biggest crisis facing the ANC in the democratic era.
