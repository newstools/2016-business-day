Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga appears to be making good on his campaign promises and has issued a R2bn tender to modernise Hammanskraal&rsquo;s water purification centre and drafted a plan to resolve the metro&rsquo;s housing and electricity issues.His work is cut out for him after taking office in August following a coalition with other parties that led to the DA governing in the metro.Tshwane is the largest metro in Gauteng, spanning more than a third of the province&rsquo;s geographical area, and it has huge issues with water provision, housing and electricity."We&rsquo;re in the process of finalising a R2bn-plus tender, which will then see the issue of water in Hammanskraal being resolved once and for all," Msimanga says.Contaminated water in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, has made many people ill. The town&rsquo;s water supply has been of poor quality for years, but the situation worsened in October and residents marched to the city&rsquo;s offices demanding a permanent solution.The problem was compounded when the Rooiwal water purification plant had capacity problems, resulting in raw sewage leaking into the residents&rsquo; water supply.Msimanga says because the problems facing the metro are wide-ranging, prioritising some issues over others is not an option. "It&rsquo;s not one or the other, we have to do [everything] at the same time."He has an ambitious plan to tackle Tshwane&rsquo;s housing crisis. His administration is not only working on clearing a backlog spanning decades, but wants to devise lasting solutions for people living in the metro&rsquo;s informal settlements."There is a project that is going to be kick-starting in Hammanskraal. We&rsquo;re looking at 8,000 [housing] units," says Msimanga. Some people of Tshwane have lived in shacks for more than 15 years.Private PartnersThe city has earmarked 12,000 units for Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, and is seeking proposals for the projects from private and public partners, Msimanga says.Tshwane&rsquo;s housing backlog stood at 120,000 at the end of 2015, and the metro has 170 informal settlements.In his inaugural speech in August, Msimanga promised to deal with the issue saying: "We are committed to establishing a housing programme that allocates housing opportunities in a clear and transparent manner that seeks to address the housing crisis through a fair, corruption-free process."However, he now says the rate at which projects are developed is not fast enough for a "lasting solution".Since August, he has prioritised plots of land for people in informal settlements who will be given title deeds to serviced stands that will have roads, water and electricity.Serviced SitesBut this does not mean a house will automatically be built on the stand, he says. Residents should build their own houses if they can, and not wait for the government to provide them.Providing serviced sites will also help curb the problems caused by illegal electricity connections."If you go into areas like Phomolong in Mamelodi, people are still connecting electricity illegally which creates a lot of problems for the people who are staying adjacent to them," he says.The city&rsquo;s chief economist, Shaakira Karolia, is examining methods of increasing revenue collection. Msimanga says the city has lost R1bn due to unpaid water and electricity bills in the past year &mdash; half of the city&rsquo;s debt of R2bn.He will be doing this work under the watchful eye of the ANC and the EFF.The ANC has challenged Msimanga to start making good on his promises to the people of Tshwane, saying residents are being denied access to services while the mayor is preoccupied with political grandstanding on corruption.The ANC has been relegated to the opposition benches, which has made for tough council meetings marred by disruptions, one of which disintegrated into violence.The EFF, which voted with the DA, allowing it to take governance of the metro, has vowed to challenge the DA when needed.EFF deputy chairman for Tshwane, Moafrika Mabongwana, says his party supports the mayor&rsquo;s plans for housing and service delivery.The party will wait until the city&rsquo;s budget is tabled next year to assess if Msimanga is making good on his housing promises.The EFF wants good-quality housing built in the metro.
