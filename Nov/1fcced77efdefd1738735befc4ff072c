Sun City &#8212; Testing conditions greeted competitors at the Nedbank Golf Challenge on Thursday and it is testament to the consistency of the leading trio that they only dropped one shot each on the opening day.A capricious breeze swirled around the Gary Player Country Club, and by the time the sun set Chile&#8217;s Felipe Aguilar, South Korea&#8217;s Jeunghun Wang and England&#8217;s Ross Fisher were the least afflicted by the gusts.They are four-under but by no means out of harm&#8217;s way. The chasing pack includes former champion and favourite Henrik Stenson, SA&#8217;s Jaco van Zyl and George Coetzee, England&#8217;s Chris Wood, Sweden&#8217;s Alex Noren and Scotland&#8217;s Richie Ramsay.The wind at Sun City does not reach gale force but its imperceptible effects from the tee to target bamboozle the unsuspecting. Fisher, a man who is on his fourth visit has at least worked out when to go hard and when to lay off.&quot;There are times you can be aggressive and there are times when you need to be strategic,&quot; explained Fisher.Stenson made a steady, unspectacular start before dropping a shot in the par-four sixth.He suffered a setback on the 13th but finished with a flurry of birdies at 16, 17 and 18 to announce his ominous presence behind the leaders.Coetzee also lamented to challenging conditions. He too had to negotiate the course not entirely sure of the outcome whenever his ball went aerial.
