South African diplomats are among the most pampered in the world, with the state footing a multibillion-rand bill for perks that include private schooling, luxury cars and eye-watering living allowances. SA boasts one of the highest number of diplomatic missions in the world. As at 2012-2013, it had 2,852 employees in its 126 foreign missions. The average spend on an individual mission was R20m. The Treasury’s Government Technical Advisory Centre has, however, warned in a new report that if the bill was not moderated, the consequences on the fiscus would be dire. In 2012-2013, SA bankrolled its diplomats to the tune of R2.5bn, and the centre projects that spending will shoot up to R3.7bn in 2015-2016. Expenditure on wining and dining was R29.9m in 2012-2013. Personnel costs and allowances amounted to R359m and R623m respectively. The big-spender missions include the consular general office in New York, and SA’s missions in London, Brussels, Tokyo, Moscow and Paris. The lowliest post in Abuja, Nigeria, for example, comes with an $80,038 annual salary and a $61,956 annual allowance. This is compared to an $11,187 allowance and $43,150 annual salary for a US diplomat in the same country. In Buenos Aires, the lowest-grade South African diplomat earns more than $58,000 a year, while one posted at a UN mission in Argentina earns more than $67,000 annually. A US diplomat posted at a UN mission in Argentina earns about $45,000 a year. In addition to the salary, a South African diplomat in Argentina gets an annual allowance of $40,608 compared to the US’s $13,424. "While the cost of living allowance methodology is a standard practice, its base rates were set high and its implementation has therefore been costly," reads the report. The centre had offered the international relations department a chance to participate in the study but it declined. Independent analyst Tom Wheeler said it was unlikely the spending would drop. He highlighted legacy ambitions, including those of former foreign affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who wanted SA to have an embassy in every African country.
