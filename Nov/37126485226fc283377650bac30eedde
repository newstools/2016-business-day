The South African bond market was trading in a stable range on Wednesday morning, but was poised to finish November on a weaker note.The yield on the benchmark R186 bond steadied at 8.990% in early session, from 9.005% on Tuesday, as market attention turned to the Opec meeting in Vienna, which aims to limit oil production in order to boost low oil prices."Moves in oil have been a little wild again recently, with the build-up to the Opec meeting offering the usual mix of rhetoric that leaves traders none the wiser about whether a deal is likely to be struck," Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said"As always, there appears to be an agreement that a production cut is necessary but, unfortunately, the implementations of such a cut is far more difficult to negotiate, hence the scepticism that followed the &lsquo;deal&rsquo; in Algiers."The yield on benchmark US 10-year treasury bond, which was recently a source of much volatility in global markets, was relatively range-bound at 2.3081% in the morning, from 2.3133%.
