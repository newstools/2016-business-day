The JSE opened marginally firmer on Tuesday on a flat Dow and mixed Asian markets as a rebound in gold shares pushed the all share higher. Banks also recovered after sharp losses on Monday with a number of positive results supporting market sentiment, notably from Telkom. The spot gold price climbed 0.72% to $1,229.04/oz after losing ground in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Gold fell to a five-month low on Monday on a surging dollar with analysts sceptical whether gold would be able to make much headway in the short term. Safe-haven demand seemed to be skewed towards the dollar predominantly, Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) analysts said in an early morning note. "This would probably persist, especially as the dollar continues to strengthen over the medium term," Nedbank said. At 9.31am the all share was up 0.31% to 49,884.50 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.28%. The gold index was up 5.48%, banks 1.74% and platinums 1.51%. The property index added 0.88% after dipping through 600 points on Monday. The Dow closed 0.11% up on Monday, recording yet another high after Trump’s victory last week. The Nikkei 225 was flat (-0.03%) and the Hang Seng rose 0.28%. Early morning market focus was on a number of company results released on the day. Among individual shares on the JSE, Telkom was 3.84% higher at R62 after the telecommunications group delivered strong interim results and resumed paying interim dividends after 13 years. Interim revenue for the six months to end-September grew 20.6% to R20.2bn. Coronation Fund Managers rose 2.07% to R71.96 after posting a double-digit decline in full-year profit, partly reflecting lower performance fees as result of volatile financial markets. Investment group Reinet increased its net asset value (NAV) by €289m to €5.5bn in the six months to end-September. The share was up 1.39% to R26.92. Retailers showed signs of a recovery after being sold off last week. Truworths was up 1.43% to R63.93 and Shoprite added 1.28% to R181.75. Mr Price, however, remained under pressure, losing 0.31% to R129.60 after reporting an interim decline of 4.1% in sales on Monday. It shed 2% on Monday and is now 35% down for the year. Sasol lifted 1.45% to R365.05 after Brent crude hit a fresh three-month low on Monday. On Tuesday morning Brent was up 1.18% to $45.195 a barrel. Among property stocks, Growthpoint firmed 1.52% to R24.07. Nedbank rose 2.14% to R220.52 and FirstRand added 1.93% to R48.52. Harmony rebounded 6.14% to R38.37 and Sibanye rose 5.55% to R34.99.
