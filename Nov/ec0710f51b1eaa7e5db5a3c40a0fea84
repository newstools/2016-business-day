Bengaluru — Gold prices on Wednesday added to gains made in the previous session as the US dollar weakened, with investors showing concern over the effect of the potential economic policies of US president-elect Donald Trump. Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,231.40/oz at 3.57am GMT, after rising 0.67% in the previous session. US gold futures rose 0.56% to $1,231.30. "At this moment there is some kind of rebound but $1,230 should be the immediate resistance level that it should not cross with a very high momentum," said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong’s Wing Fung Financial Group. He expected $1,215-$1,250 to be the trading range "just to allow some time for people to think and reflect on the possibilities of policy options for the president-elect". Trump’s election to the US presidency sent bond yields surging to 2016 highs this week, pushing the US dollar to an 11-month peak against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, as investors bet his administration’s policies would stoke inflation. On Wednesday, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, slipped back 0.26% at 99.965. "A slightly weaker US dollar also helped improve investor sentiment," ANZ analysts said in a note. However, the dollar still held near its 11-month high hit after upbeat US data gave the greenback fresh impetus. Stronger than expected US retail sales data in October pointed to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo on Tuesday said Trump’s election already may be pushing up interest rates and tightening financial markets, something the Fed would have to monitor as it decided how quickly to tighten monetary policy. Gold is highly sensitive to interest rates. Spot gold could test a resistance at $1,235/oz, a break above which could lead to a further gain to the next resistance at $1,249, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver was up 0.64% at $17.18/oz, while platinum slipped 0.1% to $934.50. Palladium was mostly unchanged at $706.20, after touching its best since October 4 at $711.70 earlier in the day. Reuters
